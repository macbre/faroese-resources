<h1>Klaksvíksstríðið</h1>
<p>The Klaksvíkstriden (Faroese: Klaksvíksstríðið) was a domestic political dispute and a popular uprising in 1955 in Klaksvík on the Faroe Islands against the Danish supreme authority. The trigger was that the chief physician at the city hospital, Olaf Halvorsen, was dismissed against the will of the residents. Shortly after the referendum on the Faroe Islands’ independence from Denmark and the introduction of internal self-government, the medical case was perceived as an untimely interference in the Faroe Islands’ internal affairs. To quell the unrest, 120 Danish police officers were sent to the town, but before they arrived, the locals blocked the entrance to the harbor with barrels and an old boat, which must have been loaded with explosives. Before it came to confrontation, a political settlement was reached.</p>
<p>Sequence of events The dispute started when the main board of the Danish Medical Association in 1953 accused the acting doctor at Klaksvík hospital, Olaf Halvorsen, of having reported for service as a doctor for the SS on the Eastern Front. The case ended with a statement of “serious disapproval” of the relationship, and thus there were no demands for exclusion, fines or other disciplinary measures, although Halvorsen was ordered to pay the costs of the case of DKK 601.50.[1] However, Halvorsen refused to comply, and he was consequently excluded from the Medical Association. He could therefore not get employment at the hospitals in Denmark, but was employed as a substitute doctor at Klaksvík hospital on 1 July 1951.</p>
<p>In 1955, however, the Faroese and Danish authorities in Tórshavn decided to fire Halvorsen, presumably because of his Nazi past, and chose instead to employ the Faroese doctor Eivind Rubek Nielsen. However, this did not go down well in the local area, where a large part of the population wanted to keep Halvorsen and saw the authorities’ decision as a Danish provocation and an untimely interference in local affairs.</p>
<p>In order to enforce this provision, national ombudsman Niels Elkjær Hansen and other representatives of the authorities traveled to Klaksvík on 21 April 1955 to carry out bailiff proceedings to remove the controversial doctor. They met here by approx. 100 angry residents who prevented the Faroese and Danish authorities from carrying out the bailiff’s business, and who instead chased the deputation through the city and aboard the liner Tjaldur, which had its ropes cut off and had to seek port in Fuglafjørður.</p>
<p>The local authorities ask for assistance from Denmark, and on 22 April 1955, DFDS’ ship M/S Parkeston sails out of Esbjerg Harbor with mate Kristian Djurhuus, six journalists, approx. 50 boxes of weapons and ammunition, an emergency vehicle and 120 police officers with six police dogs.</p>
<p>In Klaksvík, on the other hand, a guard is set up with armed men, and the entrance to the harbor is blocked with an old ship filled with explosives as a sign that they would not be cowed.</p>
<p>The incidents caused the Danish government to decide to send Finance Minister Viggo Kampmann to the Faroe Islands to mediate the dispute. Part of the settlement was that Halvorsen had to temporarily travel to Denmark, which he did, and two Danish doctors were appointed at Klaksvík Hospital in that connection. Halvorsen was no longer heard of, and the doctor who had to resign his position reacted, but waited.</p>
<p>When the half-year term of office of the two Danish doctors was coming to an end, the national ombudsman summoned the hospital board to a meeting in Klaksvík on 23 September 1955. When the delegation at 19.30 were on their way to the hospital, they were met by approx. 150 people who almost attacked them with pushes and punches and demanded that the promise given by Viggo Kampmann should be kept.</p>
<p>The frigate «Rolf Krake» docked in Klaksvík with police officers and marines.</p>
<p>The events caused the government in Denmark to react, and on 28 September 1955 the frigate Rolf Krake departed from Korsør with 30 police officers on board and arrived in Klaksvík on 1 October together with the warships “Skarven” and “Ertholm” In the meantime, Kampmann had flown to the Faroe Islands and was able to ascertain the total collapse of the settlement. On 1 October, Rolf Krake reached the quay in Klaksvík. Around 100 young people tried to force their way inside the cordon, but with dogs and batons, the police managed to maintain peace and order.</p>
<p>On 24 October 1955, the first indictments were ready, and on 15 November 1955 the verdicts could be handed down. There were 31 defendants, all but one of whom were convicted, but 18 of these convictions were appealed, of which 14 convictions were upheld and 4 overturned.</p>
<p>On November 7, 1955, an empty house that was supposed to have been used by the police was blown up. On 20 November, the lagman’s house in Tvøroyri was fired upon with a machine gun - no one was hit, however. On 22 November, a bomb was detonated outside the police station in Klaksvík, but no one was seriously injured. None of the incidents were resolved.</p>
<p>The Klaksvík dispute ended on 9 May 1956, after the hospital board employed Knud Seedorf as a hospital doctor.</p>

<p>Olaf Halvorsen’s life course Olaf M.K. Halvorsen was born in Denmark in 1913. He lost his father when he was two and his mother when he was five. After this he grew up with his grandparents in Nykøbing Falster. The grandfather died when Olaf was 14 years old.</p>
<p>He studied at the University of Copenhagen. In 1938 he joined Denmark’s National Socialist Workers’ Party (DNSAP) under the leadership of Frits Clausen, who was also a doctor. After Halvorsen completed his medical studies in 1939, Clausen arranged for Halvorsen to substitute for him in Bovrup in Southern Jutland for a few months. The attack on Denmark in 1940 led to a breach of trust and enmity between Clausen and Halvorsen, and Halvorsen resigned from DNSAP.</p>
<p>In 1948, he was accused by the general board of the General Danish Medical Association of having reported for service as a doctor for the SS on the eastern front. Halvorsen denied this, and the medical association’s arbitration court only sentenced him to “a serious disapproval” in 1949. There were no demands for exclusion, a fine or other disciplinary measures, but Halvorsen was ordered to pay the legal costs of DKK 601.50. Halvorsen refused to comply with this demand, and did not appear during the arbitration proceedings, and he was subsequently expelled from the medical association in 1950.[2][3][4] Because of the exclusion, he could not get employment as a doctor in Denmark. He was also turned down for the positions he applied for in Greenland. In the Faroe Islands, he was employed at Queen Alexandrine’s hospital in Tórshavn, where he also taught nursing students, then in Klaksvík, where he was appointed as hospital and municipal doctor on 1 July 1951.[2][3][4] Olaf Halvorsen came to Klaksvík with his wife Andrea and their two young sons.</p>
<p>Already at the constitution, both the hospital board and the national doctor of the Faroe Islands, Hans Debes Joensen, made it clear that Halvorsen had to agree with the medical association in order to be assessed for the final appointment. The representatives of the medical association adopted an amnesty for doctors who had been excluded for “unnational” behavior. However, geHalvorsen continued to refuse to resolve his dispute with the medical association. He also said that if the claim was dropped, he would take it as proof that he had been treated unfairly. The claim remained unresolved.</p>
<p>Rumors about Halvorsen’s past spread quickly, but the locals don’t seem to have cared much about it. Halvorsen gained a good relationship with the local population, although he was perceived as strictly disciplined.</p>
<p>After the Klaksvík conflict, he settled in the Copenhagen suburb of Klampenborg as a general practitioner until his retirement. He never returned to the Faroe Islands, but still had a painting of Klaksvík hanging in his living room. Olaf Halvorsen died in 1993 at the age of 80.</p>
