    "abstract": "AbstractThe French expedition La Recherche conducted by naval surgeon and naturalist Paul Gaimard (1793-1858) was one of the first major international and interdisciplinary scientific endeavours to explore the European North in the first half of the nineteenth century. Inaccessibility in English may be one of the principal reasons why La Recherche is far from receiving the critical attention it deserves. Xavier Marmier (1808-1892) was the expedition\u2019s official historian and chronicler. The Faroese chapter from his official account in Voyages de la commission scientifique du Nord, en Scandinavie, en Laponie, au Spitzberg et aux Fer\u00f6e, pendant les ann\u00e9es 1838, 1839 et 1840, sur la corvette La Recherche [1842] is printed for the first time in English translation in this issue of Fr\u00f3\u00f0skaparrit. Considering Marmier\u2019s short stay, he writes quite extensively about the Faroes. His descriptions are marked by the Romantic longing for the sublime as well as images of the North as a cold and sparsely populated place. Marmier\u2019s purpose however, did not consist solely of sharing his impressions, but to provide an official account of the voyage including the principal points of interest observed, concerning e.g. geography, economy, trade and popular culture. Marmier is in this context the typical travel writer at the time, representing modernity and progress, noticing lack of developments, suggesting improvements, having better insight and knowing the world better than the people he is visiting, while at the same time not forgetting the actual purpose of his travel, which is to gather information and introduce the reader to an unknown far away region in the world.\r\n\u00dartak\r\nFranska ranns\u00f3knarfer\u00f0in La Recherche var millum fyrstu st\u00f3ru ranns\u00f3knarfer\u00f0irnar \u00ed Nor\u00f0uratlantshavi \u00ed fyrru helvt av 19.\u00f8ld.

    "abstract": "The objective of this qualitative parallel case study was to elicit the teacher cognition of grade 8 teachers in the Faroe Islands about teaching speaking in English as a foreign language (EFL). Teacher cognition and actions were studied in context based on data from semi-structured interviews, mixed questionnaire and observations. Manual thematic analysis through using a priori and post priori codes was adopted to parse data and establish the influence of teacher cognition on teaching in the classroom and identify any common trends among participants. The results show that teacher cognition has a marked influence on teaching speaking. Congruence between cognition and teaching is apparent, with some instances of incongruence. Congruence between teacher cognition and teaching speaking rests on two factors \u2013 the marked influence of \u2018apprenticeship of observation\u2019 i.e., the influence of teachers\u2019 personal experiences from years of education that shapes their thoughts and teaching and teacher understanding of teaching speaking as \u2018doing\u2019 speaking i.e., providing opportunities for students to speak in the classroom. Incongruence stems from the core-peripheral belief dynamic, where the predominance of core beliefs over peripheral beliefs affects the efficacy of teaching speaking.",

    "abstract": "The beginning of the 19th century was hard for the people of the Faroe Islands. The weather was unfavorable, and the consequenses were dire for the farmers. At the same time, price increases in Europe forced the Royal monopoly to increase its prices, which meant, that the price of grain increased by a quarter. That was the situation, when the kelp burner Mortan Reidt arrived in the Faroes in 1804. The pastor in T\u00f3rshavn, Begtrup, saw an opportunity to found a new industry that could provide an income for the poorest people in the city. Kelp was used in the glasindustry, so if the efforts were succesful the Faroes would have been closer to the growing industry in Great Britain and Norway. The aim of this paper is to tell the story of this attempt to start a new industry in the Faroe Islands, and to explore what the story can tell us about the early part of the 19th century.\n\u00dartak\nFyrstu \u00e1rini av 19. \u00f8ld v\u00f3ru sera k\u00f8rg \u00ed F\u00f8royum, t\u00ed ve\u00f0ri\u00f0 f\u00f3r illa vi\u00f0 landb\u00fana\u00f0inum, og hv\u00f8rki grind ella sei\u00f0ur var at f\u00e1a undir landi.

    "abstract": "This mixed method pilot study aimed to elicit the impact of COVID-19 on Faroese compulsory school teachers as professionals and people in 2020-21. The objectives were to understand teacher and teaching challenges during the pandemic, positive and negative experiences, teacher evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of the crisis leadership of their school leaders, identify concerns with \u2018learning loss\u2019 and explore any evidence of organisational learning for schools. The findings reveal that teacher challenges included lack of digital competence, coping with the change in the teaching-learning environment, the difficulty in adapting to Information Communication Technology (ICT), reduced teacher self-efficacy and emotional stress. It revealed the tremendous concern teachers have for their students\u2019 learning outcomes and well-being. Teacher evaluation of their leaders is fairly positive. It is not very clear if organisational learning has resulted from the COVID-19 crisis and been anchored to provide a basis for tackling future crises. This may be significant in providing school staff resilience to cope with any future change in the external environment and the resultant consequences for leadership, teachers and students.",

This article focuses on the political parties, the party system, and Faroese governments. The article builds on the assumption that institutional settings influence the conditions for government activity. The article identifies factors for the Faroese system like a multi-party system with a weak political centre and coalition governments with larger policy stretch compared to other political systems, which means potential challenges. The investigation, however, shows that despite these identified factors, the political system has a continuous structure and also governments are rather stable at the same time as parties take turns in government coalition formation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis qualitative study was conducted to explore the impact of COVID-19 on Faroese school leadership with a view to identifying challenges faced by leaders and assessing the efficacy of their crisis leadership in enabling a positive learning-teaching environment. The findings indicated that the challenges comprised teacher self-efficacy issues in teacher ability to adopt Information Communication Technology (ICT) to fulfil student learning outcomes, ensuring student participation and safe learning environments, teacher and leader emotional/psychological burdens and hygiene logistics. Faroese crisis leadership exhibited proactive support for teachers, helped with online teaching, offered channels of open, meaningful communication, supported teachers through active listening, accepted teacher feedback, and showed an inclusive approach to managing teaching. School leaders appeared to have stepped up to the challenge despite the crisis testing the resilience of staff, students and themselves. They reflected on what COVID-19 has taught them and have grasped the significance of the human element in crisis management. The Faroese school system may require an established framework from the National Board of Education to cope with future crisis to ensure a responsive instead of a reactive approach to maintaining core competences of schools in a challenging environment.\u00dartakHenda kvalitativa kanningin var\u00f0 gj\u00f8rd\u00a0 fyri at kanna \u00e1virkanina av COVID-19 \u00e1 f\u00f8royskar sk\u00falalei\u00f0slur vi\u00f0 at ey\u00f0merkja avbj\u00f3\u00f0ingar hj\u00e1 lei\u00f0arunum og meta um n\u00fdtsluna av lei\u00f0slu-h\u00e6ttum undir kreppu til at skapa eitt fremjandi undirv\u00edsingar- og l\u00e6ruumhv\u00f8rvi.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe article examines the royal administration and taxation of the Faroese &quot;skattland&quot; or tax-land in the period between approx. 1300 and 1600 based on a retrospective methodology. Questions are asked about, how the tax was assessed, how many taxpayers there were, how many people they represented, what the tax was used for, and how great the burden was of the royal tax. The royal administration of the 16th century was established with the Landlaw of King Magnus the Lawmender before 1280, but the sources indicate that it was not fully expanded with a Lawthing before 1350-1400. In the land register from 1584, we get the earliest overview of the royal tax system, and the sources from the 16th and 17th centuries tell that the tax was a substitute for the leidang. The tax system in the land register suggests that taxable farms were listed based on a past farm count. A comparison of the fragmented Faroese source material from the High and Late Middle Ages with information from other skattlands in the Norwegian realm indicate that this past time has been approx. 1300. The land register therefore provides information concerning how many taxable farms were in the Faroe Islands in approx. 1300, and where they were. The study shows that approx. 2.471 people lived in the Faroe Islands when the tax scheme was launched approx. 1300 and approx. 3.460 people in 1584. When the number of taxpayers is compared with information from the bailiff\u2019s accounts in the 17th century, they indicate that the royal tax-rate of Faroese taxpayers was between 4 and 5% of their production in the period between approx. 1300 and 1600.\u00dartak\u00cd greinini ver\u00f0ur tann kongliga umsitingin og skattingin av t\u00ed f\u00f8royska skatt- landinum \u00ed t\u00ed\u00f0arskei\u00f0inum millum umlei\u00f01300 og 1600 kanna\u00f0 vi\u00f0 st\u00f8\u00f0i \u00ed afturl\u00edtandi h\u00e1ttalagi.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe goal of this paper is twofold. On the\u00a0one hand, it provides an overview of V1\u00a0(verb-first), V2 (verb-second), and V3\u00a0(verb-third) constructions in main clauses\u00a0in Icelandic\u00a0and Faroese, and it seeks to\u00a0explore\u00a0to what extent the two closely related\u00a0languages behave the same way in that\u00a0resepect. The data presented here support\u00a0the idea that Icelandic and Faroese have\u00a0similar conditions with respect to the possibility\u00a0of V1 and V3. However, some interesting\u00a0exceptions are pointed out, in particular\u00a0regarding the fronting of negative\u00a0objects in Faroese (V3). On the other hand,\u00a0special attention is given to the possibility\u00a0of Stylistic Fronting (SF) as a matrix V2-phenomenon in the Insular Scandinavian\u00a0languages. It has been claimed that SF is\u00a0more restricted in embedded clauses in\u00a0Faroese\u00a0than it is in Icelandic, suggesting\u00a0that Faroese is evolving in the direction\u00a0of the Mainland Scandinavian languages,\u00a0where SF has all but disappeared. Based on\u00a0that, one might expect that SF is also on itsway out in main clauses. The comparison\u00a0of stylistically fronted elements of various\u00a0kinds conducted in this study shows that\u00a0both languages obey similar restrictions.\u00a0However, certain SF-constructions are much\u00a0more restricted in Faroese than in Icelandic.\u00a0\u00dartakEndam\u00e1li\u00f0 vi\u00f0 hesi grein er tv\u00edb\u00fdtt. \u00d8\u00f0rumegin\u00a0er ta\u00f0 at \u00fatvega eitt yvirlit yvir setningsger\u00f0ir\u00a0vi\u00f0 S1 (sagnor\u00f0-eitt), S2 (sagnor\u00f0-tvey)\u00a0og S3 (sagnor\u00f0-tr\u00fd) \u00ed h\u00f8vu\u00f0ssetningum \u00ed \u00edslendskum\u00a0og f\u00f8royskum, og roynt ver\u00f0ur at\u00a0kanna, \u00ed hvussu st\u00f3ran mun tey b\u00e6\u00f0i n\u00e6r\u00a0skyldu m\u00e1lini bera seg at \u00e1 sama h\u00e1tt \u00ed hesum\u00a0sambandi.

The municipal amalgamation\u00a0process has thus far reduced the total number\u00a0of municipal regions from 48 in 2001\u00a0to 29. As a result, many traditional councils\u00a0remain alongside\u00a0new constituencies basedon larger\u00a0aggregations of citizens. Though\u00a0it is a micro nation with only 52,000 inhabitants,\u00a0the Faroese experience is similar\u00a0to that of larger countries when it comes\u00a0to tensions between different conceptionsof the municipality\u2019s\u00a0purpose. Thus, three\u00a0models to describe these municipal council\u00a0rationales will be proposed and considered:\u00a0Is a municipality\u00a0first and foremost\u00a0a community with which people identify(the social ties community model), a local\u00a0arena for finding political solutions within\u00a0community space (the local space municipality model), or is their main purpose to\u00a0serve as administrative entities that implementlocal and national goals (the municipal\u00a0administration model)? These ideal models\u00a0structure the analyses of municipal councils\u00a0in the Faroes from 1992-2016, based on\u00a0electoral and survey data.",

It is however important that CTD patients consume food with high content of\u00a0 carnitine, because natural carnitine in food is a better source of carnitine, since it is more accessible to the body than supplements of carnitine. The content of carnitine has been analysed in different kinds of food, and the levels are highest in meat products and lowest in vegetables. Studies show a positive correlation between red meat and carnitine. In the Faroe Islands there are some traditional foods were the content of carnitine is unknown e.g. the meat of pilot whale. In 2018, the levels of carnitine were analysed in meat from 15 lambs, while the levels of carnitine in the meat of pilot whale were analysed at two different times in year 2015 and 2017. The meat of pilot whale originated form 31 pilots whales (13 females and 18 males). The mean levels of carnitine in lamb meat was 1617 mg/kg while the levels of carnitine in the meat of pilot whale was 178 mg/kg. The levels in the meat from the adult pilot males was significantly higher than in the adult pilot females. The results show that lamb meat is a good source of natural carnitine and the levels are higher in lamb meat than in cow and pig meat. The levels in meat from pilot whale is much lower than in lamb meat, but higher than e.g in chicken and salmon. There are still some more natural sources of carnitine that need to be studied such as different kinds of fish species, wild birds and other traditional Faroese food. It could also be interesting to look at the effect of cooking on the levels of carnitine in food. Other studies have found that some of the carnitine went into the water fraction, when preparing the meat. In this way, gravy or broth also becomes a source of natural carnitine when consuming soup and sauce, as is common in the Faroese Islands.",

I observed a preening Starling male on Sk\u00favoy, Faroe Islands, which interrupted preening and sang a Blackbird imitation when a silent Blackbird male flew over. This observation may suggest that Starlings are able to use visual information, linked to memorized sounds, to choose their song.

In two of them the stress distribution has caused the second element to become weakened such that the sense of the name has been rendered obscure, and unclear to the language user. This has made possible a morphological reanalysis, as we can observe in the forms J\u00f3kin and (\u00ed) Gj\u00f8kkjum. The third name, Gj\u00f3kinnin, on the other hand, has preserved its original form.",

In the one case we find Halgreip as the name given to a piece of cultivated infield, in the second Har\u00f0greipa is the designation of a strip from the outfield, fenced in for cultivation, while in the third the plural form Har\u00f0greipur (or Har\u00f0greipir) is applied to three rocky slopes in the outfield. The author connects the name with the ON adjective har\u00f0greipr \u2018hard-handed, heavy handed\u2019 (found in bynames, and in appellations of giants and giantesses), and with nouns of similar import in other Scandinavian languages. Conjecture is offered about what led to the adoption of such a name in the Faroes, and it is suggested it may have referred to difficulties in cultivating the land or travelling across it.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: The purpose of this empirical study is a detailed examination of the use of English nouns in the context of written Faroese in computer-mediated communication. The data is derived from one of the biggest Faroese online forums, Kjak.org. As this approach is unprecedented in the linguistic study of the Faroese language, the methodology will be based on comparable investigations into Faroese and other Scandinavian languages. However, the focus will be original in nature, due to the phenomena observed in the data. Paying attention to various variables that come into play in computer-mediated communication in general, such as the influence of features found in spoken language, as well as complex multilingualism, this paper will scrutinise aspects of both morphological and orthographical integration of English nouns. Most strikingly, unlike in previous studies on English loanwords in Faroese, the language material investigated here displays a wide range of creative ad-hoc strategies for solving a number of linguistic problems, such as the marking of morphological boundaries, ad-hoc gender assignment, &amp;lt;\u00f0&amp;gt; as a means of breaking the hiatus etc. As the virtual absence of normative pressure in computer-mediated communication seems to be pivotal in this context, the role of language ideology will also be discussed in this paper.\u00dartak: \u00c6tlanin vi\u00f0 hesi empirisku ranns\u00f3knini er at gera eina n\u00e1greiniliga kanning av n\u00fdtsluni av ensk\u00adum navnor\u00f0um \u00ed f\u00f8royskum skriftm\u00e1li.

    "abstract": "Abstract: The article throws new light on the Danish writing Faroese author William Heinesen\u2019s long struggle for succes in his novelistic writing and for financial independence with regard to his published novels in the 1930\u2019s. The article draws on completely new archival material in the context of Heinesen, which is his correspondance with his publisher in Copenhagen, Ejnar Munksgaard. The focus is given on different aspects of sociology of literature, and except for one article (Marnersd\u00f3ttir, 2011) this angle has not been tested before on the works of Heinesen. Parameters of literature of sociology to be investigated are the role of the market, the relationship between Heinesen and his publisher, the role of the publisher\u2019s consultant Otto Gelsted, the market profile, adaptions to and discomfort for the market, the role of the readers and the role of the reviewers, sales promotions, sales figures etc. The Copenhagen publisher adds Heinesen cultural capital in various ways demonstrating Copenhagen\u2019s importance for his writing, his network and struggle to get a breakthrough as a novelist. Heinesen found resources for his publishing in Copenhagen not available in the Faroes since most Faroese readers were not emancipated to literacy in the modern sense. Thus Heinesen opens up new avenues and new cultural spaces in Faroese literature. Copenhagen becomes the gateway to the world for Heinesen in line with other world imperial metropoles being widely used by writers, intellectuals and other from former colonies as a springboard to get a breakthrough in imperial contexts and beyond. Heinesen\u2019s gole was to awaken the Nordic/ European reader\u2019s curiosity for the Faroe Islands as a new cultural and literary geography. Although Heinesen writes broadly about the Faroe Islands, he does not want to commodify Faroeseness for easy exotic consumption to continental readers. Moreover, he would blow up what he considered as a far too narrow track being his own previous carreer as a symbolist poet. Through his novelistic writing Heinesen got the Faroe Islands as a niche using the spacious novel form as a medium for the Faroese experience.\u00dartak: Greinin varpar n\u00fdtt lj\u00f3s \u00e1 tann dansktskrivandi f\u00f8r\u00adoyska rith\u00f8vundin William Heinesen (1900-91) og t\u00f3gva str\u00ed\u00f0 hansara fyri einum skald\u00ads\u00f8gu\u00ad\u00adframbroti og fyri at bl\u00edva f\u00edggjarliga \u00f3heft\u00adur sum rith\u00f8vundi.

While older research maintains that the Danish negotiator played a key role in this, more recent research has paid more attention to the role of Sweden and especially England. It has e.g. been claimed that the English really intended to annex the North Atlantic Islands to the English Crown, but that they in the last moment changed their minds and directly caused that the islands remained under the Danish Crown. In this article, it will be argued that even if it is likely that England wanted to prevent that the Atlantic islands became Swedish, there is no evidence to support that England had this role; and that the sources directly appear to disprove that the English had any intentions to annex the North Atlantic Islands to the English Crown. It is more conceivable that a lack of interest for the North Atlantic Islands was the reason for that they remained Danish.",

Large amounts of these commodities were saved before the ship in a following storm was crushed. The ship was named Venus from Sundsvall in Sweden, and the captain was Sam. Dryselius. But, remarkably, very litle is written about this event, despite the fact that it was perhaps the largest and most valuable cargo ever brought ashore. It was, after a thorough registration of every item, put up for auction, and every detail of this is writen in a minute book which gives us a detailed picture of the content of the cargo, the list of persons that were buying, and what were the prices. More than 5000 items were saved and sold for more than 12.000 Rigsdaler (In comparison, the price of 1 barrel of barley was around 5 Rdl). The local officials bought the largest amounts, but it can not have been for their own consumption alone. \u2013 The article shall in the first place clear up the event and illuminate the auctions. The next problem is to attempt to follow how and where the commodities were forwarded. It is stressed that small-scale shopping is not the same as illicit traffic. One event can be documented. The skipper Poul P. Nols\u00f8e brought an amount og Manchester-cloth to Norway, and sold it to a merchant there. This is undoubtly an incidence of smuggling. But the assumption is put forward that most of this cloth and textile was sold in exchange for sweaters that were shipped to Denmark as \u201dsendingsgods\u201d (private commodities shipped by the Royal Trade Mono\u00adpoly).",

In con\u00adnec\u00adtion with this an attempt is made to eluci\u00addate the two concepts \u201cuncartographic place-names\u201d and \u201ccartographisation of place-names\u201d. It is clear enough that the most usual pro\u00adcedures back in 1901 were (a) to reject names that consist of several words (i.e. form a phrase) and to replace them with compounds, e.g., \u00c1in \u00ed Dal \u2018Stream-the in Valley [i.e., The Stream in the Valley]\u2019 &amp;gt; Dal\u00e1 \u2018Valley Stream\u2019, \u00c1in Svarta \u2018Stream-the Black [i.e., The Black Stream]\u2019 &amp;gt; Svart\u00e1 \u2018Black Stream\u2019, and (b) to remove adverbs and prepositions and use a nominative form instead, e.g., Uppi \u00ed Botni \u2018Up in Valley\u2019 &amp;gt; Botnur \u2018Valley\u2019. Attention is drawn to the fact that names which were once rejected often make a reappearance in later maps. There is also brief discussion of names with pre\u00adpositions that appear in place-name records and feature in place-name research.",

The relationship between the old-established villages and the newer deve\u00adlop\u00adments is described. Particular emphasis is placed on determining the geographical areas referred to by the names Runav\u00edk, Hei\u00f0arnar and Saltangar\u00e1, and on explaining these names. The first element in Runav\u00edk is taken to be either runi m. \u2018hog\u2019 or run f. \u2018small stream\u2019. As far as Saltangar\u00e1 is concerned, which since the middle of the nineteenth century at least has generally been seen as the name of a stream \u2013 and subsequently also used of the new village \u2013 the author supports the suggestion of G\u00f6sta Holm (1992) that it was originally applied to a whole area: *Salthandara \u2018the area beyond Saltnes\u2019. It was once the name of part of the Toftir outfield, but in the middle of the nineteenth century became used of a new settlement in the Glyvrar outfield, also known as Glyvrahei\u00f0ar or Hei\u00f0arnar \u2018the Glyvrar peat bogs\u2019. The name Saltangar\u00e1 has thus moved from Toftir to Glyvrar.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: There have been 14 referendums in the Faroe Islands about very different issues. In this paper these referendums will be analysed in relation to the use of referendums in the Faroe Islands \u2013 from the perspective of the political system as well as from the view of the voter. A comparison will be made with similar referendums in Denmark, Iceland and Australia. An attempt to classify Faroese referendums in accordance with international research will also be done. The conclusion in the article is 1) that historical and cultural conditions, especially the Danish Faroese relations, have influenced several of these referendums, even referendums that are not about these issues, 2) that referendums in the Faroe Islands haven\u2019t always been well prepared by the political authorities, 3) that party politics usually have significant influence and 4) that the majority of the voters usually have used the vote to demonstrate against the more or less party politically biased intentions of the political majority that often have been underlying Faroese referendums. Generally speaking, this article concludes that if referendums are to be a real successful alternative to representative democratic deci\u00adsion-making then they have to be preceded by negotiations where both \u2013 all \u2013 relevant oppos\u00ading sides agree on the referendum terms. This is especially very important when it comes to definitive referendums on secession.\u00dartak: Ta\u00f0 hava veri\u00f0 14 f\u00f3lkaatkv\u00f8\u00f0ur um n\u00f3gv ym\u00adisk vi\u00f0urskifti \u00ed F\u00f8royum. \u00cd greinini ver\u00f0ur hugt eftir hesum f\u00f3lkaatkv\u00f8\u00f0unum vi\u00f0 atliti at hvussu f\u00f3lkaatkv\u00f8\u00f0ur hava veri\u00f0 br\u00faktar \u00ed F\u00f8r\u00adoyum, b\u00e6\u00f0i t\u00e1 ta\u00f0 sn\u00fdr seg um politisku skip\u00adanina og veljararnar.

A few informa\u00adtions are found i older sources, but generally these overestimate the yield. Landt and Svabo, however, are more realistic and propose the average yield to 7 (i.e. harvested amount in relation to sown amount). They are also aware of the difference in the yield, where Sandoy and Su\u00f0uroy are the best grain-growing places. The impressive amounts of information in the socalled L\u00f6bner tables make it possible to obtain a detailed picture of the situation in all of the villages in the country in 1813. The problem is illustrated from three questions: How much was sown in relation to the popu\u00adlation? How was the yield/sown amount? And how big was the yield in relation to the popu\u00adlation? The first question says somthing about the effort in each village to be self-sufficient with grain, while the last question will tell us to what extent these efforts were succesful.",

    "abstract": "In the 19th century the population of the Faeroe Islands grew from 5,200 in the 1801 census to 15,200 in the 1901 census. The leading question in this paper is derived from this fact. What was the material and ideological background for this profound change that caused changes in all parts and corners of the society? This leads to the problem definition: \u201dWhere did the new things and thoughts come from, and who came with them?\u201d Theories on innovation and diffusion are implemented in the analysis. In the 1st section of the paper the situation in the Faeroese society is described with concrete examples. The 2nd section applies the diffusion theory with the concepts carriers and barriers. The 3rd section adds the concepts base and superstructure that are coupled with the already mentioned concepts in the second section. In the 4th section some concepts and methods from economic geography, population potential and threshold values are presented and used. In the ending an effort to quantify the innovation process is presented. This leads to a recapitulation of concepts in the foregoing sections, but also to new questions as the result of these, especially figure 4, are unforeseen and provoking. A society as the Faeroese, tiny in scale and remote in location, and therefore with a low population potential, cannot be expected to produce many \u201dthings and thoughts\u201d by itself. In the 5th section some local persons of virtue are mentioned, as well as a row of civil servants who all came from mainland Denmark. These were carriers of ideas from the European enlightenment movement and other ideas that widened the material base of the growing population. The legal base, laws and statutory elements, that changed the possibility for the landless class to acquire land came from outside, from the King, and generally the barriers were the local land-owning class. A main point in this process of change is the introduction of the Amtmand, the Governor of Prefect, in 1816, that was the beginning of the setting up of a local centralized administration. Later, with the Danish Constitution coming into force in 1849, the first democratic assembly on the Faeroe Islands was elected. Further, the Constitution had no place for the Royal Monopoly Trade; it was abolished in 1856.",

Ten Open Top Chambers (OTCs) were placed inside an enclosure with control plots both inside (CtrlE) and outside (CtrlO) the enclosure. The difference in vegetative growth of the two species Salix herbacea and Polygonum viviparum and graminoids were monitored as well as the frequencies of the four functional types: herbs, graminoids, woody species and bryophytes. It was found that warming generally increased leaf length by around 30% with similar or larger increases in photosynthetic leaf area. Grazing reduced leaf length by around 30% for graminoids and Polygonum viviparum, but only by around 10-20% for Salix herbacea. The changes in frequencies of functional types were most pronounced for bryophytes and woody species during the latter part of the experiment when both grazing-exclusion and warming increased the frequencies of bryophytes and decreased the frequencies of woody species.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate effects of acute sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) ingestion on performance during a football-specific protocol, with reference to mediating effects of intermittent training status. Methods: Ten male university football players (age: 21\u00b11 yrs, height: 180\u00b12 cm, mass: 78.8\u00b12.8 kg) completed two six-a-side football matches after ingesting either 0.4 g.kg-1 NaHCO3 (staggered over 90-min) or no supplement (CON) in a randomised, counterbalanced order. Activity profiles, blood [lactate], HR and gastrointestinal distress determined throughout. Training status was evaluated using Yo-YoIR1, Yo-YoIR2 and repeated-sprint tests. Results: Players performed 70.3% more high-speed running (17-21 km.h-1) during 0-5min following NaHCO3 ingestion vs. CON (17.9\u00b15.2 vs. 10.5\u00b13.1 m, P&amp;lt;0.05). No other significant activity profile differences, including high-intensity running (HIR; &amp;gt;14km.hr-1), existed between conditions during any period (P&amp;gt;0.05). However, total HIR increased for 70% of participants following NaHCO3 vs. CON (P&amp;gt;0.05). Large-very large correlations (0.5&amp;lt;r&amp;lt;0.9) existed between training status measures and HIR improvement from CON to NaHCO3 during certain match periods (P&amp;lt;0.05). Conclusions: Acute NaHCO3 ingestion appears ergogenic for some, but not all, football performance measures. Furthermore, individual variability in HIR response suggests this ergogenic potential is not realised by everyone. Correlational analysis suggests higher intermittent training status may potentiate NaHCO3 efficacy.",

The first element of Akrinatj\u00f8rn \u2018Akrinatarn\u2019 is explained as the plant-name akurull (Eriophorum angustifolium). The M\u00f8lbur- of M\u00f8lbursvatn \u2018M\u00f8lburswater\u2019 is seen as a reflex of *Melber\u00f0i, compounded of ON melr m. \u2018gravel-bank\u2019 and *ber\u00f0i n., a derivative of bar\u00f0 n. \u2018edge, rim\u2019; the original name of this lake was thus probably *Melber\u00f0isvatn. It is further suggested that the first element of the name M\u00f8lheyggjarnir \u2018the M\u00f8l heights\u2019 also comes from an original melr rather than m\u00f8l f. The confusion of e and \u00f8 in M\u00f8lbursvatn and M\u00f8lheyggjarnir is to be seen in the light of the delabialisation that characterises the dialect of this area.",

    "abstract": "In this article the author identifies the variation between i and u in weakly-stressed position in Faroese, and especially in morphological endings, as a result of specific changes which have taken place during the development from Old Norse to the modern language. An attempt is made to account for the changes, and it is conjectured that they are for the most part the result of a desire to make the grammatical system simpler and more transparent. Suggestions are also offered about when the changes took place, and where in the Faroes they originated. Attention is drawn to the fact that coalescence between i and u is not limited to a geographically continuous area, and that the innovation cannot therefore have begun in just one place and spread out from there, but must, as far as can be judged, have developed in both the southernmost and northernmost parts of the country. Particular emphasis is placed on showing that the changes occur in stages, and on the fact that the variation can be presented in the form of a scalogram, which indicates it is not arbitrary. Attention is finally directed at the influence the written language and school teaching have on the system which has developed in the language naturally.",

    "abstract": "In contemporary Faroese, the genitive as verbal and prepositional case has been replaced by the dative or the accusative, e.g. b\u00ed\u00f0a eftir m\u00e6r \u2018wait for me-DAT\u2019 or b\u00ed\u00f0a m\u00e6r \u2018wait me-DAT\u2019 instead of b\u00ed\u00f0a m\u00edn \u2018wait mine-GEN\u2019, and frequently also til hann \u2018to him-ACC\u2019 instead of til hansara \u2018to him-GEN\u2019. Genitive attributes are no longer in use either. In contrast, the system of linking elements in Faroese compounds, originating from the genitive endings, e.g. dag+s+verk \u2018days work\u2019 (cf. dag-s \u2018day-GEN.SG.\u2019), is subject to continuous development. In this paper, we first discuss the unproductive status of the genitive case. Against the background of the declining genitive, we will then show how the linking elements dissociate functionally and formally from their inflectional (genitive) source. We argue that the contemporary linking system of Faroese comprises different stages of this development. An important stage of dissociation is the (development of) non-paradigmatic linking elements, i.e. linkers which are not homophonic with any inflectional ending of the noun, e.g. +s+ in \u00fathur\u00f0+s+lykil \u2018outdoor-LE1-key\u2019, but \u00fathur\u00f0-ar \u2018outdoor-GEN.SG.\u2019 The decline of the genitive case has played a decisive role in the recent formal development of the linking system. Our acceptance test with novel and non-sense compounds shows the ongoing formal dissociation of the paradigmatic linker +ar+ into non-paradigmatic +a+, where the latter is used more often in front of obstruents.Keywords: historical genitive, linking elements, case loss, compounds, paradigmatic and non-paradigmatic linking elements, syntactic case.",

    "abstract": "Since the investigation performed by Solh\u00f8y between 1977 and 1979 (Solh\u00f8y, 1981) no organized investigation has been performed on the distribution of land snails in the Faroes. Intense importation of building and gardening materials has since increased the risk of introducing new snail species to the islands. This article is based on material and observations from observers around the islands over several years, who have contacted the first author. This has resulted in the discovery of seven new species to the islands in addition to Solh\u00f8y\u2019s twenty species. Four of the new species are snails, while two are slugs. An additional species was introduced for commercial purpose but does not seem to have survived well in the Faroese climate.It is difficult to predict the consequences of the settlement of these new Faroese gastropod species, but they may act as intermediate hosts for parasites, having cats and dogs as final hosts.",

    "abstract": "This paper sheds light on the problems that emerged in the 19th century Faro- ese society when radical changes in population, production, trade as well as culture took place. The author follows the rising difficulties in collecting the fish tithe, as it is described in the biannual reports from the local sheriffs, legal disputes, correspondance with the governmental offices in Copenhagen as well as documents from the prolonged considerations in the local parliament, the L\u00f8gting. It becomes clear that not only changes in the ways the fishing was performed had an impact. The diverted changes in people\u00b4s culture and conception of law lead to a situation where old customs and moral altered. The old law on fish tithe had to be rescinded. It happened in 1892 after 17 years of debate in the local parliament.",

    "abstract": "The content of the preserved lists of Sendingsgods or private shipments of goods from the Faeroe Islands for the period 1805-55 is analyzed. This is a period when different steps towards the abolishment of the Royal Monopoly Trade were taken. The mentioned shipments consisted of commodities that legally were sent with the Royal Monopoly Trade\u2019s ships by private individuals. It is made clear which person groups were involved in this activity as senders, and which persons or firms in Denmark were receivers. Furthermore it is analysed how the range of commodities varied over time and what the reasons for this variation have been. It can be said that the activity with this kind of private shipment of goods has had an upbringing effect as a preparation to a civil society with freedom of trade and commerce. Persons who after the abolishment of the monopoly trade achieved a trade-license were often persons who in their previous work had been accustomed to handling and transporting goods, to write invoices and to keep accounts. The paper is seen as a contribution to the understanding of the transformation of the society from a medieval, feudal to a capitalistic one on the Faeroe Islands.",

    "abstract": "The potato became an important crop in the Faroe Islands early in the 19th century and subsequently vital in the 1820s and 1830s, when crofters started to enclose and cultivate small plots of land. These plots of land were crucial in ensuring population growth and in extending cultivated land. Local officials followed these events closely. During the 1830s problems emerged concerning the quality of seed potatoes and the limited supply, problems which only intensified as time passed. Concern was raised by one sheriff that difficulties in finding new seeds would prevent the expanding cultivation, whilst others worried that the deterioration in seed quality would result in a decline in growth, thus jeopardizing the livelihood of crofters. In this article the story of seed potatoes purchased by governor Pl\u00f8yen in Orkney in 1839 is followed. The point being made is that by acquiring these seed potatoes the authorities ensured that the progress of the previous 20 years continued. Furthermore, the purchasing of a shipment of seed potatoes is linked to other modernization plans for Faroese society, which governor Pl\u00f8yen and others worked on at the time. For these plans to succeed, it was vital to ensure the living conditions of the crofter families as change would not emerge from the old peasant society.",

Vider\u00f8 (1906\u00ad1991) trespass the border between fiction and non\u00ad fiction and are difficult to define in relation to genre. A definition of genre is on the other hand crucial for the way we read them. K.O. Vider\u00f8 wrote about himself and about travels, events and people, he experienced, but he did so in his own imaginative way. The article discusses relevant theories of genre and the problems connected to at final definition of K.O. Vider\u00f8\u201cs writings. The publication \u00c1 Su\u00f0urlandi\u00f0 (1990) is analyzed and used as an example of how Vider\u00f8 found it hard to adjust himself to the limitations of traditional genres and indirectly wrote about it.

An attempt is made to show what factors have determined this variety: time, place, circumstances or particular events. One of the passes was, for example, connected with the death of a priest in the Reformation period and named after him. It is also suggested that F\u00f3lkaskar\u00f0 \u2018people's pass' is unlikely to have been a name that was ever actually in use. More probably, it was proposed by place\u00adname collectors as a contrast to Neytaskar\u00f0 \u2018cattle pass\u2019.

    "abstract": "This article is about a Faroese conflict in the 1950ies between the majority of the citizens in Klaksv\u00edk and the authorities in T\u00f3rshavn\u00a0regarding the resignation of a Danish doctor at the hospital in Klaksv\u00edk. The doctor, Olaf\u00a0Halvorsen, who had a Nazi past in Denmark\u00a0during the Second World War came to the\u00a0hospital in T\u00f3rshavn in 1948 and was in\u00a0April 1951 transferred to Klaksv\u00edk where he gained overwhelming support throughout the\u00a0local population. In the meantime, however,\u00a0Halvorsen was accused by the Danish doctoral\u00a0community for having had Nazi sympathies\u00a0during the Second World War. In 1949 the\u00a0Danish doctor\u00b4s union arbitration gave him a\u00a0reprimand for his \u00b4national conditions` during\u00a0the war. He was not sentenced any penalty, e.g.\u00a0he was not excluded from the Doctor\u00b4s union,\u00a0but the arbitration sentenced him to pay the\u00a0courts costs, 601, 50 Danish Crowns, which he refused to do. This had the effect that Halvorsen lost his membership in the union, which was a precondition for practicing as a hospital doctor. Despite local support the authorities could not let him remain as a doctor at the hospital. Instead, a Faroese Doctor, attached to the leading family in Klaksv\u00edk, was employed at the local hospital.This apparently minor case developed into a widespread and long\u00adlasting conflict between the vast majority of the citizens in Klaksv\u00edk and the authorities in T\u00f3rshavn and later also the Danish authorities in Copenhagen that e.g. involved Danish warships with large numbers of police officers at the harbour in Klaksv\u00edk, bombs exploding at the police station and gun\u00ad shots at the Faroese prime minister. During this uprising, which lasted for more than two years, from 1953\u00ad1955, lawlessness was the rule in the second largest city in the Faroe Islands, until the Danish authorities at last restored law and order in the city.The sources behind the article are basically unpublished and so far unexploited primary material from both public archives and private collections in the Faroe Islands. While the main story is well known the analyses of the primary material in this article leads to revisions and new conclusions on the subject. On the analytical level a distinction will be made between the underlying historical and structural conditions behind the outbreak and development of the conflict and the primary actors in the conflict; and on the methodological level a comparison between the nonofficial governmental sourc\u00ad es and the public sources will be used to reveal possible discrepancies between the authorities intentions regarding solutions of the conflict and the picture that the authorities \u2013 intentionally or unintentionally\u00a0\u2013 gave the public. This article documents\u00a0on the empirical level major discrepancies\u00a0between the authorities real unofficial inten\u00ad\u00a0tions regarding a solution of the conflict and\u00a0the picture that the authorities gave to the\u00a0public.The argument in the article is that it was\u00a01) developing tensions between the industrial\u00a0capital Klaksv\u00edk in the North and the administrative capital T\u00f3rshavn in the south, 2) socio\u00adeconomic conditions in Klaksv\u00edk, the\u00a0real industrial capital in the Faroe Islands, and\u00a03) later on also tensions between the strong\u00a0Faroese separation movement and Danish\u00a0authorities, which were the main content\u00a0in this major rebellion. It was, however, the\u00a0combination between some powerless Faroese\u00a0home\u00adrule authorities and reluctant Danish\u00a0authorities, which was the main reason for that\u00a0this uprising developed into a real rebellion in\u00a0Klaksv\u00edk. During the two years of lawlessness\u00a0in Klaksv\u00edk the conditions could be and were\u00a0used by rebels in Klaksv\u00edk and political parties\u00a0in the Faroe Islands, which had other goals\u00a0than to solve the problem.This exploitation of the conflict, which only\u00a0was made possible by a powerless space in the\u00a0Faroese political realm, escalated the conflict\u00a0further, but in the end this was a rebellion\u00a0without clear winners. In conclusion it was\u00a0not as often argued a united village population\u00a0(95%) that challenged the local Faroese and\u00a0later on the Danish state authorities, but\u00a0it was basically a divided population split\u00a0across political as well as religious lines that\u00a0afterwards had to face a troubled self\u00adimage,\u00a0which many were not proud of.In a broader context the conflict about\u00a0the doctor can be interpreted as a rebellion against the new home rule system of 1948 and its attempt to centralize the new political and administrative power in T\u00f3rshavn.",

    "abstract": "The rules for payment of tithe varied in the 19th century in the Faeroe Islands. Concerning wool tithe, there are some issues, never dealt with before, to be examined, as the tithe was paid for each slaughtered lamb, but the tithe was paid in wool. The problem is that the lambs and older sheep were slaughtered in autumn, while the wool was removed from the older sheep (not the lambs) in May and June. Therefore, the collection of wool could not wait for the slaughter in autumn. How was this problem resolved in practical terms, and how was the collection organized? There was an \u2018on account\u2019 system that is described in this article. Another accounting system was practiced when it came to the young of the Manx Shearwater, called l\u00edrar in Faeroese. The material base of this tithe consisted of a limited number of units that could not be divided further into smaller units. Therefore, it was necessary over time to keep records of the distributed tithe and the arrears so that the three recipients, king, clergyman and church, could have their rightful share.",

    "abstract": "Fifteen bryozoan species were found on three species of brachiopods in the Faroe area, but only two of the brachiopod species can be regarded as common biogenic substrates for bryozoans. Incrusting bryozoan species were the most diverse compared to other growth\u00ad forms. A maximum of five species were found on one valve, but usually from one to three species. Most species were found in restricted depth zones and they can be regarded as accidental epibionts due to the absence of any relationship between the bryozoan species richness and brachiopod abundance in total. Diplosolen obelia and Disporella hispida are the most common species, their frequency of occurrence exceeding 50% and their abundance correlating significantly with the brachiopod abundance. The preference of some brachiopod species as substrate for bryozoans is related to the morphology of the brachiopod valves. Boreal and boreoarctic species predominate in the study area. Occurrence of arctic forms of bryozoans corresponds to the waters with low temperature, where significant relationship is found between them and brachiopod abundance, although the last one is low in the cold water area.",

    "abstract": "Maturation, reproduction and early life history of Lophius piscatorius was investigated in Faroese waters. Length at first maturity (L50) was 58 cm for males and 84 cm for females, corresponding to an age of about four years for males and seven years for females. The proportions of females and males were similar in fish less than 55 cm long, and were skewed towards more males in medium sized fish (55\u201375\u00a0 cm).\u00a0 Females\u00a0 were\u00a0 predominant\u00a0 in the larger fish (&amp;gt; 85 cm). Observations of spawning males and females, egg ribbons and pelagic anglerfish larvae, suggest that the main spawning season is from February to April and the spawning area seems to be southwest of the Faroe Plateau and in the Faroe Bank area. The Faroe Plateau probably serves as a nursery ground for juvenile anglerfish. Morphological transformation from larvae to juveniles occurred when the fish were about 7\u20139 cm long and they settled to the bottom when they were about 11 cm long. Thus, all life stages, as well as nursery areas, spawning areas and feeding areas of anglerfish are found in Faroese waters, indicating a separate stock in the area.",

The subject-matter derived \u2013 through intermediates \u2013 from the Icelandic F\u00e6reyinga saga (abbreviated: F\u00e6r.s.orig.). This saga\u00a0 had\u00a0 been\u00a0 composed\u00a0 shortly\u00a0 after\u00a0 1200, and\u00a0 it\u00a0 is\u00a0 now\u00a0 known\u00a0 only\u00a0 from\u00a0 excerpts\u00a0 in three texts: (1) the separate \u00d3l\u00e1fs saga helga, (2) the longest \u00d3l\u00e1fs saga Tryggvasonar, (3) Flateyjarb\u00f3k. \u00a0These \u00a0excerpts \u00a0were \u00a0recollected \u00a0in 1832 and later, forming a new F\u00e6reyinga saga (abbreviated: F\u00e6r.s.rekonstr.).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 question\u00a0 raised\u00a0 here\u00a0 is:\u00a0 Which\u00a0 were the intermediates through which the subject\u00ad matter \u00a0had \u00a0passed \u00a0from \u00a0F\u00e6r.s.orig. to the poet of Sigmundarkv\u00e6\u00f0i\u00f0 eldra? The answer adopted here is: Through the longest \u00d3l\u00e1fs saga Tryggvasonar or parts of it. Some versions of the ballad contain elements which must derive from Flateyjarb\u00f3k, but they were probably introduced into the ballad after 1770, when the Faroese subject-matter in Flateyjarb\u00f3k was retold in Danish.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The last part of the passing of the subject-matter to the poet may have been an oral tradition originating in a reading of the above-mentioned saga. We do not know when and where this reading occurred. A possibility is: in the 16th century at or near Bergen.",

    "abstract": "This article is exploring a controversial subject in the history of biblical translations in accordance with modern historical and philological research. In the article a specific subject, the Emmanuel prophecy in Isaiah 7:14, used by Mathew 1:23 as a prophecy about the miraculous birth of Jesus, will be examined in accordance \u00a0with \u00a0modern \u00a0international \u00a0research and modern bible translations, and compared with the Faroese bible translations from 1949 and\u00a0 1961.\u00a0 The\u00a0 main\u00a0 question\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 article is, limited to this specific and controversial subject, to explore the boundaries between Christology, historical context and philology in the Faroese bibles. The conclusion is 1) that the historical context of Isaiah 7:14 is related to historical conditions in the prophets own time in 734 BC, 2) that neither of the Faroese bible translations are consistent in their use of Faroese words to translate even the same Hebrew or Greek terms, and that 3) the reasons for the choice of Faroese words are Christological rather than philological, when philological demands, textual or historical context and historical research contradict important Christological interpretations. The comparison with other\u00a0 modern\u00a0 bible\u00a0 translations\u00a0 shows\u00a0 that this is not a specific Faroese problem or dilemma. These translations are, if not simply wrong, created to justify Christian interpretations of scripture.",

From Norway it seems to have reached the Faroes towards the end of the sixteenth century at the latest, but is only documented on Fugloy. In the seventeenth century the name arrives in the Faroes once more,\u00a0 but\u00a0 now\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Danish\u00a0 form\u00a0 Lauge, later written Lave. It is used in T\u00f3rshavn and Su\u00f0uroy in the eighteenth century as the second element of the compound forename Peder Lave. In the nineteenth century Lave becomes an established surname. In T\u00f3rshavn it is also incorporated into the name of a dwelling in the prepositional form \u00c1 Lava \u2018at Lava\u2019, and people living there (or originating from the house) are given the by\u00adname \u201e\u00e1 Lava\u201c. In the twentieth century some of them take \u201e\u00e1 Lava\u201c as a surname. The author treats language\u00adhistorical, phonetic, morphological and dialectal aspects of the name.",

Obviously one might analyse language variation from different points of view. The term linguistic market economy refers to Pierre Bourdieus sociology of culture. On the linguistic marketplace linguistic products have certain values, and the language is used as cultural capital. This point of view disagrees with the claim of Saussure that speech is individual. My contribution is to show which mechanisms are active when language is used.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The inspiration to my approach is Pierre Bourdieu. He actually disagrees with linguists, who claim that meaning of words is within the words themselves. On the contrary, Bourdieu says that the power comes from the social circumstances in which the words are used. He claims for instance that if an individual shall obey an instruction, it must be given of a person with authority and symbolic power.",

It is a story of an old Dionysiac Faroese ritual, which died out around The Second World War. The narrator sets himself the task of transplanting this Dionysos into modern fiction.\u00a0 Due\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 muteness\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Gryla the literary connection to the myth can only be established by virtue of interpretation as demonstrated as an explicit mediation of the mythical silence. The muteness appear as a matter of interpretation while being encircled in\u00a0 conflicting \u00a0images. \u00a0Focus \u00a0is \u00a0partly \u00a0given on the interpreted Gryla as a complex question of ontological interpretation and partly as an expression of cultural translation linked to aesthetic development in the geographical periphery. Due to the muteness of the Gryla, the whole story appears as a course of naming the nameless forces that work within Dunald, who is the one having the Gryla. Based on Franco Moretti\u2019s og Andreas Huyssen\u2019s notion of \u2018centre and periphery\u2019, the question of translation is connected to the Faroe Island as a non\u00admetropolitan culture. Due to the cultural backlog in the periphery there is a special need for translations caused by the discrepancy between the trans\u00adatlantic modernity and a minor culture as the Faroese still close to nature and the oral tradition. In response to the cultural backlog the dynamics of translation become a privileged perspective creating connections between\u00a0 \u00a0modern\u00a0\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0 premodern\u00a0\u00a0 aspects. The Faroese reaction represents an alternative modernity and an alternative (geo)modernism writing back to a rule\u00adbased hegemonic modernity an modernism in order to give an account of the encounter with another world, which evades direct contact and brings into question what is periphery and what is centre.",

This was in 1914 and many welcomed the book, but there were also quite a few who were unhappy about it. They felt that the publication in Faroese was a provocation against Denmark or Danish language in the Faroes (Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir, 1990). The opposition against Robinson Crusoe in translation sheds light on a problem, which the Faroese book market has suffered and partly still suffers, namely people\u2019s attitude towards their mother tongue.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although today\u2019s opposition against Faroese is not comparable to that generated by publishing a book in 1914, language is still a very sensitive topic in children\u2019s books. The problem is first and foremost caused by the Faroes\u2019 political situation, as a part of the Danish kingdom, which has meant that the language used in public administration, school, church and parliament in the Faroes was Danish.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Faroese have always spoken their own language, but have only recently started writing it. Only in the latter half of the 19th century steps were taken to generate a Faroese grammar. We must also bear in mind that written Faroese was not taught in Faroese schools until 1920, and it was not until 1937 that the Public School Act was amended, making Faroese, rather than Danish, the teaching language.",

The temperature was experimentally elevated with hexagonal greenhouses called open top chambers (OTC\u00b4s) made by polycarbonate. The experiment was conducted in an alpine area at 600 m a.s.l. where the flowering stage of Silene acaulis was measured regularly during the growing season from May to July in ten OTC\u00b4s and ten control plots. In this paper, we present observations from 2001 and every year from 2007\u00a0 to\u00a0 2010. We\u00a0 measured\u00a0 four\u00a0 events\u00a0 in the flowering stage: first visible bud (FB), first flowering\u00a0 date\u00a0 (FO),\u00a0 first petal\u00a0 drop (FPD) and last petal drop (LPD). This experiment is a part of \u201eThe International Tundra Experiment\u201c (ITEX) that is a collaborative, multisite experiment using a common temperature manipulation to examine the influence of climate change on vegetation. The results from our experiment showed statistically significant changes between the OTC\u00b4s and the control plots for all four events. Typically, the events occurred about one week earlier in the OTC\u00b4s. The length of the flowering period from FB to LPD was not significally different in the OTC\u00b4s from the control plots. The warming induced by the OTC\u00b4s in our experiment was only about 1oC in the summer and less than that in the winter. This and other confounding effects such as sheltering imply that care should be taken when using our results to predict phenological in the Faroes changes induced by global warming.",

Optical devices for night observations have been available for a long time but have rarely been used to study nest\u00adsite attendance by this species.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I studied the daily nest\u00adsite attendance, chick feeding schedule and incubation rhythm of the Northern Fulmar at a small colony on the Faroe Islands throughout night and day for two years using surveillance cameras with infrared LEDs. The attendance patterns were analysed to see if they correlated to sunrise, sunset and day length and analysed in relation to time of day for incubation shifts, and feeding of the chicks. Since a previous study showed that the diurnally migrating Glacier lantern fish (Benthosema glaciale) was an important part of the diet of the Northern Fulmars on the Faroe Islands (Danielsen et al., 2010), I postulate that the birds would be away from the colony at night, in order to forage out at sea.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore underlining the importance of doing observations during both day and night is the fact that although birds might show signs of breeding by staying faithfully at the nest and apparently incubate during day\u00adtime, this is not necessarily true when also adding observations during the night. This can easily lead to biased estimates regarding how many of the birds in the colony are actually producing eggs. This information is important for e.g. estimating breeding colony size (Mallory and Forbes, 2007).",

Such \u2018scalping\u2019 of the land surface is a recognised feature of peatland landscapes in the Northern Isles of Scotland and reflects the need for past human populations to obtain peat, even if population pressures result in the total loss of a valuable resource. Such aspects are discussed together with a consideration of the archaeological features which have been revealed from beneath the peat by scalping on N\u00f3lsoy.",

The \u201eoffer\u201c, which according to J\u00f3annes Patursson was given to him by the Danish \u00a0government, \u00a0would \u00a0have \u00a0given \u00a0the Faroese \u00a0Lagting\u00a0 \u00a0greater \u00a0administrative \u00a0and financial self\u00adrule in internal Faroese matters. The Faroese people rejected the offer in 1906, and \u00a0the Danish legislative minister, Peter A. Alberti, who had signed the letter with the offer to the Lagting, was in 1908 forced to leave the government and was sentenced eight years imprisonment as a result of his involvement in a financial scandal. It has since been said that, according to the Danish government, the offer given to J\u00f3annes Patursson was a private offer from Peter A. Alberti, of which the Danish government had no knowledge. This article argues, that the offer was given to J\u00f3annes Patursson by the Danish government, and that the Danish government never accused Peter A. Alberti of having given J\u00f3annes Patursson a private offer. This story is a myth, created later, totally without any historical foundation. Peter A. Alberti was a likely candidate to blame for an unsuccessful political offer, but in this case, he is certainly not guilty in any violation of governmental authority.",

In 1823 the Danish Bible Society had published a Faroese translation of the whole of Matthew by J.H. Schr\u00f8ter, pastor on Su\u00f0uroy, the most southerly island in the group. However, Schr\u00f8ter had used a southern dialect in his translation, and S\u00f8rensen wanted to show the Bible Society what a translation into a northern type of Faroese would look like. He therefore sent the Society his rendering in 1826. In the article S\u00f8rensen\u2019s and Schr\u00f8ter\u2019s translations are compared. It is shown that S\u00f8rensen does little more than amend Schr\u00f8ter\u2019s text. However, he not only gives it a more northern flavour but also brings it into closer harmony \u00a0with Danish. These texts are among the first attempts to write Faroese prose, although the two translators take different linguistic paths.",

A case is also made for there being a connection between Mikkjals t\u00e1ttur and another ballad, Abba Nouva, which appears in extremely garbled form in the ballad manuscript Fugloyarb\u00f3k (from before 1854). The author considers there is a strong likelihood both ballads portray one and the same person, and he hazards a guess about who this person might have been. It is also suggested that Djurhuus may be behind both ballads.",

It deals with the connection between this Faroese composition and the Danish ballad Dansk Kongetal (DgF 115). Dansk Kongetal is in effect a rehearsal of the names of Danish kings. A Faroese poet has taken this text as a model for a ballad that lists the names of dogs in a Faroese village. The composer may have well been the poet Jens Chr. Djurhuus (1773\u00ad1853), but this cannot be fully substantiated. There are two variants of the ballad, and both are reproduced here diplomatically. They represent two different Faroese dialects, those of the islands of Koltur and Fugloy, and the article draws attention to the dialectal characteristics as they appear in the manuscripts. Apart from this, Hunda t\u00e1ttur is a valuable source for Faroese dog names; nowhere else do they appear in such numbers.",

C. Svabo compiled and prepared a manuscript for a Faroese-Danish-Latin dictionary, which however did not appear in his lifetime. Svabo constructed an orthography based on the spoken usage of words. In 1846 V. U. Hammershaimb published some texts in a new orthography based on etymological principles. The first Faroese dictionary appeared in print in 1891 as part of Hammershaimb\u2019s F\u00e6r\u00f8sk Anthologi. In 1927/28 appeared F\u00f8roysk-donsk or\u00f0ab\u00f3k by M. A. Jacobsen and Chr. Matras, an expanded edition was published in 1961. In the second half of the 1900s, several dictionaries were published, all bilingual. The most comprehensive dictionary, F\u00f8roysk or\u00f0ab\u00f3k, appeared in 1998 incorporating about 66,000 words. Moreover, this dictionary differs from the older ones in that meanings and definitions of the words are provided in Faroese and not in a foreign language. In the article is illustrated how Faroese lexicography reflects impacts of puristic activities and changing language politics over the years.",

It is primarely a modern Norwegian interpretation of the Faroese chain dance. The Norwegain folkevisedans played a central role as a cultural expression to the nation building and cultivation project of The Movement for Norwegianness (norskdomsr\u00f8rsla). The article gives a short introduction to Norwegian folkevisedans, its origin and historical development. Encounters with and ideas about authentic Faroese dance has been, and still is, an important topic in the Norwegian discourse on the aestetic and stylistic ideals of folkevisedans, sangdans and stordans. The article discusses two such cultural encounters, in which Faroese dance groups have visited Norway. These encounters have had an impact for the development of the folkevisedans in Norway, and to some extent they have given rise to a dissension between Folkevisedans enthusiasts.",

My hypothesis is that Faroese pilot whaling is most likely a local innovation. I argue along two lines. (1) Pilot whales have been relatively rare in Norwegian coastal waters, and catches were too infrequent to find an institutionalized form. Norwegian fishermen had neither knowledge nor equipment to hunt pilot whales efficiently, and each hunt had important idiosyncratic characteristics. (2) Whereas pilot whales and other small toothed whales in the Faroe Islands were driven ashore, they were in most places in Norway enclosed by seines. This difference had important socio-economic implications. Technology as well as regulations and practices pertaining to pilot whaling and distribution of the catch in the Faroe Islands must therefore be understood in its local context and nothing emigrants brought from Norway about a millennium ago. Whalers in the Faroe Islands and Norway were motivated by quite different cultural models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: The breeding biology of the Faroese house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is described based on the results from nestlings that were ringed just before they were fledging. By means of dates and numbers, the beginning and duration of the breeding seasons are determined and the reproductive output is estimated. Our study has shown that Faroese house sparrows produce two, occasionally three, broods annually. Overall, eggs of the first, second and third clutch are normally laid in the beginning of May, in the middle of June and in the beginning of July, respectively. In a season, a female produced 6.3 nestlings, on average. For the whole period, the average brood size was 3.5 nestlings. During the first part of the time series (1985\u00ad1989), the breeding season became earlier each year, but then to be later again in the years 1990 to 1992. The first clutch was laid more than five weeks earlier in 1989 than in 1985 and the second clutch almost seven weeks earlier.\u00a0\u00dartak: \u00c1rini fr\u00e1 1985 til 1992 v\u00f3ru tilsamans 347 gr\u00e1spurvaungar (Passer domesticus) \u00a0merktir \u00ed bygdini N\u00f3lsoy, beint \u00e1\u00f0renn teir v\u00f3ru floygdir.

In return for Norway, Denmark was given Pomerania and Rugen, the Swedish provinces in Germany. At the last moment, the treaty between Denmark and Sweden was changed, so the Norwegian islands in the North Atlantic, Greenland, Faroe and Iceland, should not be ceded to Sweden with Norway. The sources are rather silent on the reasons for this change. Different hypotheses have been put forward. Here the hypothesis is launched, that it is possible that the British demand for the island of Heligoland caused the Swedish crown prince and commander-in-chief Karl Johan relinquish on the islands in the North Atlantic in order to get the peace treaties signed at once so that he could prevent a conflict with his allies, especially the British, who were rather upset because he had pursued his own war aims instead of following the allies in their westward thrust in order to topple the reign of the emperor Napoleon.",

More specifically, I have found it of interest to explore the topic by comparing indications seen in the Faroese linguistic community with others in a similar linguistic situation, i.e. a situation where there is a considerable difference between the vernacular and the standard variety. In this respect it may be useful to opt for the term diglossia, or a degree of diglossia. In addition to this particular phenomenon, I have also considered and discussed the fact that Faroese native speakers are exposed to the first foreign language at a very early stage in their education, as is the case in the other linguistic communities with which we may compare the Faroese. This exposure and thorough learning of the former coloniser\u2019s language is considered necessary in order for the young student to go to universities abroad for further studies.The Faroese community has not been organised in socio-economic layers comparable to the post industrial West. Because of this fact it has been considered that other linguistic variables must be explored than the division of the speakers into socio-economic groups as has been the traditional method within sociolinguistic research. The point of departure taken for this article has been to include gender, degree of education, i.e. university studies vs. shorter education, as well as the social identity that the individual speaker may choose in any given speech situation. Hence, with theories presented by contemporary sociolinguistic researchers as a basis, this article attempts to discuss the Faroese situation with these variables as a foundation.The material for the article stems from the author\u00b4s master thesis in 2006, where distinct differences between the genders seemed to be present with respect to choice of vocabulary. A small investigation has been repeated for this article in order to assess whether the tendency seen then would reoccur in 2009.Although the outcome of this small investigation seems to support the findings that derived from the material for the master thesis, it should be emphasised that the conclusions should be read as indications of what may be the situation in the Faroese linguistic community in respect of gender and language choice. I am fully aware of the fact that a more comprehensive investigation will be required to enable reliable elaborations on this very interesting topic.",

The article focuses on leisure, social interaction and cultural identity in order to understand and define the position and role of the car among young people. The risk behaviour and attitude of drivers is investigated with these questions in mind: How do young people interpret their own risk behaviour? How do young people communicate experiences and information concerning the safety and danger of driving? The article aims to give a fresh view on a field that has been characterized by strong prejudiced societal condemnation of young people\u2019s attitudes and behaviour.\u00a0\u00datrakHesin tekstur, i\u00f0 hevur st\u00f8\u00f0i \u00ed granskingarverk\u00e6tlan um ungd\u00f3m og bilmentan \u00ed F\u00f8royum, l\u00fdsir og greinir meiningar, vir\u00f0i og symbol, i\u00f0 ung geva bilum og bilkoyring \u00ed dag.

Later, research carried out within different branches of science and using the most advanced technology has proved the validity of his conclusions and the theory of evolution has been established as a scientific theory. However, the ideological battle has far from ended. The most recent attempt to have the theory of evolution excluded from schools and other institutions of learning is having what is called intelligent design established as a scientific theory. Using three literary texts as points of departure, the writer deals with different aspects of this ideological battle and concludes that this is not, indeed, a controversy about knowledge and truth, but about control and power.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: Nest-site attendance was monitored on a year-round basis by using video surveillance cameras at 10 potential nest-sites in a small colony of Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) in the Faroe Islands. In the colony 27-34 nests-sites were occupied each year; 25-38% contained egg and 0-10 young were fledged. Altogether 40 potential nest-sites were identified during the course of the study (2004-2007) 18 of which were actively used for breeding (i.e. egg-laying) in 1-4 years. Although few birds were marked and individually identifiable some cases of change of partner and/or nest-site were shown to occur. Successfully breeding pairs departed the colony at the end of August or early in September, whereas those that lost eggs in June left earlier though stayed for several weeks before leaving; hence, individual length of post-breeding absence (coinciding with primary moult) varied between 105 and 180 days. First arrivals mostly occurred in second half of December, though at this time of the year the nest-sites were only intermittently attended with considerable individual variation. During the pre-breeding period nest-site attendance peaked in April immediately followed by a marked drop and a pre-laying exodus in May. This general pattern was true for one-bird-attendance and the simultaneous attendance of two birds (presumably a pair) at the nest-site. In 2006 and 2007 the pre-laying exodus (defined as no. days in a run without the presence of the pair) at the individual nest-sites started between 21 April and 4 May and lasted for 21 to 32 days. In two cases when the length of the exodus could be related to sex the male had a shorter exodus than the female. A return from pre-laying exodus did not always result in egg-laying (2 cases). In 2006 and 2007 copulations were observed between 11 and 30 April and 20 April and 1 May, respectively, though without any distinct peaks. Besides, copulations occurred at all times of the day. The total number of successful copulations (3-33), time between first and last copulation (2-19 days), and mean numbers (1.0-8.3) per day with copulations varied considerable between the sites. No eggs were laid in the two nests with the lowest mean number of copulations.\u00a0\u00dartak: \u00cd eitt \u00e1r v\u00f3r\u00f0u 10 m\u00f8guligir rei\u00f0ursta\u00f0ir eygleiddir vi\u00f0 vakmyndat\u00f3li \u00ed eini l\u00edtlum havhestab\u00f8li \u00ed F\u00f8royum. \u00cd havhestab\u00f8linum var havhestur \u00ed 27-34 rei\u00f0ursta\u00f0um hv\u00f8rt \u00e1r; \u00ed 25-38% av teimum v\u00f3ru egg, og 0-10 ungar v\u00f3r\u00f0u floygdir.

Of these, five species are gall midges (Cecidomyiidae, Diptera), two are eriophyid mites (Eriophyioidea, Acarina) and three belong to various families of fungi. All findings are new records for the Faroe Islands. Seven species cause galls on various host plants, namely the Cecidomyiidae, Oligotrophus juniperinus causing bud galls on Juniperus communis and Contarinia floriperda inducing flower bud galls on Sorbus aria; the Eriophyoidea, Aceria pseudoplatani on leaves of Acer pseudoplatanus and Aculus anthobius on stems and flowers of Galium anisophyllum; and the fungi Cronartium ribicola galling leaves of Ribes nigrum, Melampsora caprearum on leaves of Salix phylicifolia and Puccinia violae on leaves of Viola riviniana. Three non-galling gall midges were associated with gall-causing organisms, viz. Mycodiplosis melampsorae and Clinodiplosis cilicrus, both phytosaprophagous species associated with decaying plant matter, and Feltiella acarisuga, a zoophagous species preying on tetranychid mites. Oligotrophus juniperinus, Contarinia floriperda and Puccinia violae are native to the Faroe Islands with regard to the origin of their host plants; and the remaining species are alien and were introduced to the Faroe Islands by man. From the biogeographical point of view Oligotrophus juniperinus, Contarinia floriperda, Aceria pseudoplatani and Aculus anthobius are European species, Mycodiplosis melampsorae and Clinodiplosis cilicrus are Euro-Siberian species and Feltiella acarisuga is a cosmopolitan species. The finding of C. floriperda in the Faroe Islands is the most northern occurrence in Europe. The low species number of gall-causing organisms in the Faroe Islands is the result of geographical isolation and natural conditions of these islands with relatively poor vegetation and lack of trees and shrubs, which may be potential host plants of gall-causing organisms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: For ages people have brought plants with them, when they have settled in new areas. The characteristic flora around villages is a proof of this. Around monasteries, churches and in the oldest parts of settlements, old gardens with cultural plants that have been used as spices, medical herbs, to dye clothes with, and as ornamental plants, are found. Many of these plants were introduced to the Nordic countries in the Medieval Age or before, and other indigenous plants have been collected and planted. In the Nordic countries, botanists have known about this characteristic flora in settlements from the Medieval Age, for more than 200 years. In the Faroe Islands, botanical studies have shown that these gardens are also found here. In summer 2008 we visited 35 villages originating from the Medieval Age or before. Beforehand, we selected 25 species of vascular plants that most likely were used in these times. The investigated areas were around the oldest part of the villages, around churches in churchyards, and in areas of excavation. These plants were put into two categories, those who are indigenous and those who are introduced. In this paper a presentation of these plants are given as well as their distribution in the 35 selected villages.Resum\u00e9: Mennesker har gennem alle tider bragt planter med sig, n\u00e5r de bosatte sig i nye omr\u00e5der. Den karakteristiske flora omkring bebyggelser er bevis p\u00e5 dette. Ved klostre, kirker, i gamle landsbyer osv. findes ofte gamle haver med kulturplanter, som tidligere har v\u00e6ret brugt som krydderurter, l\u00e6geplanter, planter til at farve t\u00f8j med og prydplanter. Mange af arterne er indf\u00f8rte til Norden i middelalderen eller tidligere, og andre er hjemmeh\u00f8rende arter, som tidligere har v\u00e6ret indsamlet og dyrket. I Norden har det i snart 200 \u00e5r v\u00e6ret kendt blandt botanikere, at der findes en s\u00e6rlig flora ved middelalderlige bebyggelser. Botaniske unders\u00f8gelser viser, at s\u00e5danne haver ogs\u00e5 findes p\u00e5 F\u00e6r\u00f8erne. I sommeren 2008 bes\u00f8gte vi 35 bygder fra middelalderen eller tidligere. Vi havde p\u00e5 forh\u00e5nd udvalgt 25 plantearter som sandsynligvis blev udnyttet p\u00e5 den tid. Vi unders\u00f8gte omr\u00e5det omkring den \u00e6ldste bydel, rundt om kirkeg\u00e5rde, og ved udgravninger. Disse planter blev delt i to kategorier, dem som er hjemmeh\u00f8rende og dem som var blevet indf\u00f8rt. I denne artikel omtales disse planter samt deres udbredelse i de 35 udvalgte bygder.\u00dartak: F\u00f3lk hava fr\u00e1 fyrndini tiki\u00f0 plantur vi\u00f0 s\u00e6r, t\u00e1 i\u00f0 tey fluttu b\u00fagv.

Half of the recoveries were reported within 8 weeks, 25% already within 3 weeks. In most cases (68%), the cause of death was unknown. However, \u201ckilled by cat\u201d was the most common known cause. The median life-span for the Faroese house sparrows is 4.1 months, and average age at death is 1.3 years.

The annual catch has ranged 0-774 whales in 1-10 pods. The pod size has ranged 1-544 (avg. 60 whales) with 74% &amp;lt; 50 whales/pod. Most white-sided dolphins were observed south off Su\u00f0uroy and 37% dolphins from 20 pods has been killed in V\u00e1gur and Hvalba. The drives peak in September and none has occurred in March and December. Offshore the whale has been reported all year round. A discoloured whale occurred in two catches.",

The excerpt in question is provided below in the Latin original and in English translation, both from the 1967 edition, followed by my com- ments. One sentence in the excerpt in particular is discussed. The sentence has been used to support a hypothesis that a part of what is traditionally thought to refer to the Faroe Islands, may instead refer to the Shetlands. Finally a second hypothesis is discussed. This hypothesis proposes that nothing in the text in question refers to the Faroe Islands. Both hypotheses are rejected.",

In very simple terms diglossia may be described as the linguistic situation in a society where two varieties of the mother tongue have their function in mutual distribution; the Low (L) variety in the daily language and the High (H) in a formal context and as the written variety. During the field work for the author's Master's thesis, numerous observations were made of a highly varying language use amongst the 118 informants. This brought to mind the thoughts about a potential diglossic situation in the Faroese speech community.\r\nDiglossia as such is a highly complex topic, about which prominent linguists have presented highly varying theories. For that very reason the article does not pretend to present any conclusions to this question with respect to the Faroese conditions. Rather, it has been the intention to approach the issue on the basis of Ferguson's fundamental principles. The objective ahead, however, may be to work with the topic in a more comprehensive context.\r\nThe organization of thisarticle will imply, amongst other items, that Ferguson's distinctive markers for diglossia - nine altogether - have been discussed from a Faroesepointofview. In thediscussion, each of these nine distinctions has been commented on with examples from Faroese that have been detected in the conversations with the aforementioned 118 informants.\r\nAdditionally, in connection with the preparations for this article, a 'mini research' has been&amp;nbsp;conducted during the summer of 2008 amongst 12 informants, selected randomly amongst the 118 mentioned above, with respect to their attitude to Danicisms in the Faroese language.",

Faroese has been the subject of Danish infiuence for centuries, resulting in numerous loanwords and different structural borrowings. Today we can say that Faroese does not behave as a typical Insular Scandinavian language (lcelandic) or as a typical Mainland Scandinavian language (Danish, Norwegian, Swedish), falling instead in many cases in between the two as a Mid-Scandinavian language, though with a tendency to change towards the Mainland Scandinavian languages.",

However, the inhabitants of V\u00e1gur have never recognised this form and insist the place concerned was never called thus. In the article the author discusses the name and suggests an interpretation. He concludes that the original name was Sk\u00favisn\u00f8s (which can as easily be written Sk\u00favusn\u00f8s). The second element, n\u00f8s 'nose', is a descriptive term for a particular landscape feature. The first element is the bird-name sk\u00fagvur (Stercocarius skua) in the genitive singular, originally sk\u00favs, but with the addition of a svarabhakti vowel. Locally, however, the form Vestun' i N\u00f8s has been the more common appellation. The Danish ordnance survey, who made the maps, construed the second element as nes (Danish nces). They deemed sk\u00favis a grammatically irregular form and replaced it with Sk\u00fava-, the genitive plural. When in 1943 the British army built a LORAN (long range navigation) station at the spot, it was given the name Sk\u00favanes, and as a result this form became the one generally used.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\nThe article analyzes the conflicting reality of place and modernity in J\u00f8rgen-Frantz Jacobsen's Dano-Faroese novel Barbara (1939). The description of this breaking is based on Michel Foucault's conception of heterotopia. In the figure of heterotopia the traces crosses each other. The locality gets its dynamic by virtue of the way it acts on the stranger. The article will underline three examples of heterotopia in the novel: 1) the colony/place 2) the ship and 3) the novel 'itself' (e.g. the many Faroese expressions) with the ship Fortuna as the most important one. The article however consideres heterotopia to be far more than just a Dano-Faroese contact zone. The changing times are being connected to modernity as a crisis for language and metaphysics. The heterotopia is expressed as a dynamic understanding for this crisis in both the interpretive space of art and in the space of action of modernity. The novel is explained as a critical commentary to the Enlightenment era which regarded the illusion and imagination to be a false view on things. In other words Barbara conveys a meaningfull, inhabited modernity that functions as a correction to more rationalistic versions of modernity. Barbara is conceived as a writing-back from the periphery to European metropoles and modernity in order to give an account of the encounter with a world outside the main current of enlightenment. The main character, Barbara represents something other-worldly in terms of the 'barbaric' and untamable desire, that is released in contact with the outside world.

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\nThe article analyzes the historical ballads \u201eEirkur og Rollar&quot; and \u201eRodmunds kv\u00e6\u00f0i&quot; by Jens Hendrik Djurhuus (1799-1892). The first ballad is a rewriting of the story about the Danish king Frode Fredegod in Saxo Crammaticus Cesto Danorum. The \u201eRodmunds kv\u00e6\u00f0i&quot; is rewriting an Old Norse \u201efornaldar&quot; story. Djurhuus was long considered as an oral poet but as a manuscript from his hand was discovered in 1982 it became known that he had written at least one of his ballads himself and a part of another.\r\n\u201eEirikur og Rollar,, (Eric and Rollar) is the complete ballad from Djurhuus' hand. It is about two young men who are sent to Denmark to spy for the Norwegian King G\u00f8ter. The ballad only uses the introduction of Saxo's story where the two Norwegians get the guardians of king Frode who is an adult at the time of the story put aside in order to let Frode reign himself. This can be seen as a comment on the historic situation of the Faroes which in 1815 were separated from Norway.\r\nThe ballad is even more interesting as one of the very few pieces of the Romantic literature in Faroese written in a period of time where the written language was Danish. It is probably composed sometimes after 1829 as a continuation of the oral ballads that were collected and written down during the 19th century. Djurhuus' ballad is the very first poem in Faroese that is introduced by a nature metaphor\r\nThe article also characterizes two more ballads of Djurhuus: \u201eRodmunds kv\u00e6\u00f0i&quot; that is incomplete from his hand and tells the story of the Old Norse story of Hr\u00f3mundar saga Gripssonar. The last ballad mentioned in the article is \u201eGotuskeggjar&quot; which attributed to Djurhuus and tells a story from another lcelandic story, F\u00e6reyingasaga.\r\n\u00dartak\r\nGreinin vi\u00f0ger tr\u00fd kv\u00e6\u00f0i eftir Jens Hendrik Djurhuus, Sj\u00f3varb\u00f3ndan yngra: \u201eEirikur og Rollar&quot;, \u201eRodmunds kv\u00e6\u00f0i&quot; og \u201eG\u00f8tuskeggjar&quot;.

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\nDuring an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), Carabidae was one of the factors used to assess the impact of land drainage for hydropower. The areas investigated were outfields; these areas included a broad range of habitats, and therefore the distribution of Carabidae in the areas in question provided information about the distribution of Carabidae as a whole, which this paper aims to describe. Fourteen of the 26 previously recorded Carabidae species were found. One species Agonumfuliginosum was recorded for the first time in the Faroe Islands. Another Carabidae Bembidion bruxellense was recorded for the first time in Eysturoy. Altitude and season were seen to influence the abundance of some carabids and this is related to the distribution of preferred habitats and to reproductive cycles. The distribution of Carabidae and theeffects of outfield drainage are discussed in this paper.\r\n\u00dartak\r\nEin \u00e1rinskanning var\u00f0 gj\u00f8rd fyri at finna fram til, hvussu avveiting av lendi kann \u00e1virka l\u00edvverurnar \u00ed lendinum.

The verbs have so far been regarded as synonyms, of which ver\u00f0a, making a part of the old Norse lexical inventory, has been considered \u2018good language\u2019, whereas bl\u00edva has been considered an unnecessary loanword from Plattdeutsch. Consequently, bl\u00edva has not been much used in the written language due to the purist traditions in Faroese.The article has been written with a view to highlighting the distribution of the two auxiliaries in the present tense in the verbal language. This has been done from a diachronic as well as a synchronic viewpoint. The discussion is based on interviews with native speaking informants that were conducted in connection with the author\u2019s Master\u2019s thesis.Although the defense has been considerable against bl\u00edva, the conclusion seems inevitable that the auxiliary has entered the verbal language. However, the distribution of the two verbs in the spoken language seems to reflect a semantic difference, and this distinction is the main focus of this article. In order to be able to discuss the dissimilarities, therefore, the semanticcharacteristics have been studied grammatically as well as tested in new phrases by reverting to a group of informants that constitutes 10% of the original lot.",

In the first part, we look at Faroese, and will show how Danish loanwords help us establishing default gender, as more Danish common gender nouns end up as neuter than neuter as common gender. The second part focuses on gender assignment in Catalan words that have lexical cognates in Spanish and which differ in gender in the two languages. It observes usage trends among three age groups (3-5, 19-23 and 32-40 years old) differing mainly in the degree of Catalan received at school. The speakers are from two districts of Barcelona (Gr\u00e0cia and Nou Barris) differing in the presence and usage of Spanish.",

A man, Torluf Gregersen, rural dean of the Faroe Islands from at least 1579 until his death in 1625, is mentioned in the last two of the three lists. N. Andersen and H. J.

Explicit aims were to install a work ethic and moral uplift of the criminal poor, and to promote new industries, especially manufacture. The plans were aborted after some years, but resumed in three instances in the 19th century, modelled by contemporary poor politics and criminal politics, the spirit of which was to use imprisonment with hard labour rather than corporal punishment for lawbreaking, such as begging and stealing. The workhouse never came into being, and complaints of begging vagrants continued. Public officials in charge of implementing the planned institutions saw a main obstacle to restricting begging in the failure of farmers and other well-to-do people to give up the old habit of giving alms to the poor rather than reporting them to the police authorities for prosecution. This ambiguity is interpreted as on one hand openness to modernization in the spirit of Enlightenment, and on the other hand a slowness to concede the power of discriminating between right and wrong, between worthy and unworthy beggars, and a scepticism in an extended system of police and juridical authorities.",

The hindcast spans four periods, each of one-month duration, which cover the roughest sea states recorded on the Faroese shelf in the period 1999-2004.\r\nThe model results are generally close to the measured values in most inspected parameters, but there is some under-estimation of the peak wave height in the individual storms. A seasonal variation in the model performance is observed with larger negative bias in the predicted wave height in the winter months. Aconsistent positive bias is observed in the predicted mean wave period in all events and at all locations, indicating a slight underestimation of the high-frequency content of the modelled wave-spectra. Otherwise, the modelled spectra correspond well to the observed spectra, but are found to be slightly smoother in the low frequency range.\r\nOverall, the model is found to give good comparison with measured data, and is therefore a good candidate for providing forcing to a high resolution local wave model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\nIn 2000 an enclosure experiment was established at one lowland ( 70 m a.s.l ) and one alpine (600 m a.s.l.) site in the Faroe Islands. After five years of enclosure, significant increases were seen in vegetation biomass at both altitudes as both the cover and vegetation height increased. Five species changed their abundance significantly. Only minor changes of species loss and gain were seen. Palatable grasses increased their abundance in enclosed plots, both at the lowland and the alpine site.\r\nRoots from Agrostis capillaris were examined for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonisation, and the colonisation found to be greater at grazed plots. The plant species that had a significantly negative response to grazing were typically classified as normally mycorrhizal, while species that proliferated in grazed plots were either classified as rarely mycorrhizal or as lesspalatable.&amp;nbsp;\r\n\u00dartak \r\n\u00cd 2000 var\u00f0 fari\u00f0 undir at kanna gr\u00f3\u00f0ur vi\u00f0 at seta gir\u00f0ingar upp til at halda sey\u00f0i burtur.

We will compare the real language situation with purisms as an ideology; we express the opinion that purism will not have any large influence on Faroese sentence processing as it is for example incapable of accepting the actual languagesituation where the active language (Danish) interferes with the selected (Faroese) setting, from time to time, the language frame. We will refer to Faroese as the selected language = SL (ta\u00f0 valda m\u00e1li\u00f0) in this article, and Danish as the active language = AL (ta\u00f0 virkna m\u00e1li\u00f0), active in the sense that it does everything the SL does, except having access to the articulators. TheFaroese-Danish structures we see emerging are not corrupted, but instead a case of language building.",

However, Michael Barnes\u2019 article from 1978 concerning grammatical instability notes that a number of emendations have been made in the printed edition, sometimes acknowledged, sometimes not. In any transcription from a manuscript emendations are to be expected, e.g. modernisation of the spelling when transcribed from older forms of the language, but in the case of Corpus Carminum F\u00e6roensium there are also a number of syntactic and semantic emendations. This article explores the question of arbitrary emendations of F\u00f8roya kv\u00e6\u00f0i by comparing the manuscripts of Gongur\u00f3lvs kv\u00e6\u00f0i (CCF 29A) \u00d3lavur Riddarar\u00f3s (CCF 154A), and Skr\u00edmsli\u00f0 (CCF 90B) to their respective printed versions in the corpus.",

The youth chat culture of the Faroe Islands is characterised by local adaptation of global technologies of information and communication. The revival of the popular public sphere, which used to be associated with pre-modern society, is obvious in cyberspace: chat communication is not ruled by any \u201cbourgeois\u201d publicsphere; it is free direct commun icat ion uncontrolled by the cultural or political elites of society. This article is based on fieldwork among Faroese youth 2003-04 and aims to elaborate and update the local media debate of the 1980s and 1990s with reference to new research results from different countries.",

Yet, little is known about how children themselves experience and mediate consumption in their cultures. The reason for this is primarily grounded in the adult-centric approach which has traditionally been applied in research with children. Therefore, this paper attempts tounderstand what role consumption plays in the con struction of identity among children from a child-centric perspective. The paper draws on an ethnographic study conducted in Scotland and uses these findings to map out some areas which usefully could be explored in the Faroese context.",

Wheras the villages used to be quite isolated they are now mobilely integrated with each others. This means firstly that the dwelling-practices connected to living in a village are changing, but secondly it also undermines the common perception of the villagedwelling. As young people become \u2013 and have tobecome so in order to not being left behind \u2013 very mobile, parts of the traditional village-perception still remain in the imaginations of the young people. Seen from this point of view the village becomes a very ambivalent and even paradoxical phenomenon that balances between tradition and modernity; between place-tiedness and mobility. In the article I also discussthe lack of meaning in distinguishing between urban and rural life-modes in an age of mobility.",

We further tested the importance of the non-climatic parameters of altitude, total vegetation cover and LOI (loss on ignition), and the climate variable of annual mean temperature in describing the abundance variation of life-forms. We found that as altitude increased, the abundance of hemicryptophytes decreased linearly; the abundance of therophytes and geophytes increased linearly; and the abundance of chamaephytes varied parabolically, with the lowest abundance around 400-500 m. The abundance variation of hemicryptophytes seems to be as wellcorrelated with total vegetation cover as with altitude, while total vegetation cover was the best parameter to describe the variation in abundance of therophytes. Annual mean temperature was the most important parameter for describing the abundance variation of chamaephytes and LOI was the most important parameter describing the variation of geophytes. Weconcluded that the abundance rela tionship between hemicryptophytes and chamae phytes changed with altitude as the vegetation changed from temperate to arctic vegetation.",

The analysis takes its point of departure in Heinesen\u2019s novella Dilettanterne (1980), which can be read as a \u2018greeting\u2019 from Heinesen to Plato. Characters, imagery and style give strong indications that Heinesen works consciously and at times clearly intertextually in extension of Plato\u2019s view of Eros and of Man.The novella refers back to the core of Plato\u2019s views, creating a tension between Eros as unfulfilled desire and the consequence of this side of life, which is the eternal dream of roundedness. At the same time, the plot is read as an inspiration by, a corrective to and an updating of Plato\u2019s classical treatment. The difference between Heinesen and Plato is that Heinesen is writing under the influence of the 19th century critique of the fallacies of idealism.Dilettanterne thus turns against the romantic interpretation of beauty, where tangible reality is veiled by elevated poetic language. The article describes how the novella criticizes exaggerated romantic fantasy, though without the definitive Enlightenment rejection of mythical fantasy.Even though Heinesen and Plato do not undertake precisely the same valuation of the connection between the Beautiful and the Good, one can fundamentally understand why Heinesen desired to interpret Faeroese dilettantes on the basis of Plato\u2019s dialogue, which is a kind of modern basic language of Eros.",

In the pre-bloom period the biomass of phytoplankton was low (&amp;lt;3 mgC m-3 on average), but during midbloom the biomass was 201 mgC m-3 on average. The protozooplankton biomass was only slightly higher during mid-bloom (3.5 mgC m-3) than during prebloom (1.4 mgC m-3). The large oceanic copepod Calanus finmarchicus dominated the copepod biomass with more than \u00be during both periods. Pseudocalanus spp. dominated small neritic copepods during prebloom while Acartia longiremis and Temora longicornis were more numerous during mid-bloom. As a result of spawning success a clear shift in development stage composition towards younger stages was observed from pre- to mid-bloom. The estimated grazing impact on the phytoplankton by the protozooplankton and the copepods was negligible during mid-bloom. However, during pre-bloom the copepod grazing impact on the phytoplankton standing stock was potentially high. Our results suggested that grazing by the protozooplankton during pre-bloom was negligible.",

In total 1043 cod (on average 59.1 cm) were recaptured (16%), often during the first year after tagging. The results showed that cod from all areas of the Faroe Plateau aggregated on the main northerly located spawning site \u201cNor\u00f0havi\u00f0\u201d whereas cod south-west of Faroe Islands, in addition to \u201cNor\u00f0havi\u00f0\u201d, also migrated to a spawning area located west of Faroe Islands (\u201cV\u00e1gahavi\u00f0\u201d). The duration of the spawning migration to or from the spawning areas only lasted a few weeks. The migration, that was not associated with spawning was quite limited, often less than 10 nautical miles from the tagging locality. There were, however, some fish, that moved to new and distant areas on the Faroe Plateau. Migration distance was positively correlated with fish length and varied between tagging areas and years. Extremely few cod moved out of Faroese waters.",

The stable fly breeds in dead and decomposing plant material e.g. dung mixed with straw. If the temperature is higher than 18 \u00baC the species can reproduce all the year in the byres. Both sexes are blood feeding and attack vertebrates with preference for cattle and other ungulates. By high fly population the biting activity can result in reduction of milk and bodyweight in the livestock.S. calcitrans was probably introduced into the Faroes in imported cattle feed. Since the first reports on flies biting man were received in 2002, the species was probably recently introduced. In the Velbasta\u00f0ur area the species is widespread and probably mainly dispersed by exchange of cattle or forage. To reduce the fly problem it is important to maintain a high standard of hygiene in the byres. To control the fly it is recommended to use releases of the parasitoid wasp Spalangia cameroni.",

It is suggested in this article that it is possible to interpret the name as a compound with str\u00e6ti + li\u00f0, where the first part of the compound has the meaning 'path' that has been there, and the latter refers to a place where the path has past through the border between the cultivated infield and the uncultivated outfield. This border is not to be seen anymore, but Giljar\u00e6tt ('the sheepfold in Giljar') has once been there down on the bank, and this indicates that there has indeed been a border between infield and outfield.",

An additional 3 species collected indoors are reported for the first time (viz. Araneus diadematus, A. quadratus, and Tegenaria atricd) and hence the current total number found in the Faroes is 83.

In recent years also black guillemot eggs have been sampled for the purpose of environmental monitoring. The eggs have been gathered on Sk\u00favoy and Koltur and have been analysed for pollutants such as mercury as well as for stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon. The present article is a synthesis of the mercury data gathered in these projects studying mercury in various black guillemot tissues and age classes. The overall mean feather and liver mercury concentrations in 33 individually analysed birds was 4,72 mg/kg and 1,11 mg/kg respectively, thus with a ratio between them of 4,2. There were large individual variations especially among the males, but significant differences in liver mercury concentration between adult and juvenilescould not be discerned. The mercury concentration in eggs sampled at both locations decreased from an average of 0,46 mg/kg in 1999 to 0,32 mg/kg in 2001.",

These matrices are blue mussels, peat and soil, and even Arctic char. These results indicate that there are elevated concentrations of mercury in the Faroes. On the other hand, the European moss survey in which the Faroe Islands have participated since 1996, indicate that the mercury concentrations in Hylocomium s. is overall lower in the Faroes than in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. An indication, which also fits well with the model results that deposition of mercury in air/precipitation in the Faroes is generally lower by a factor of two than in Denmark (Christensen, 2003). Thus, the question apparently is limited to one of describing how the amount of mercury that is transported to the Faroe by long-range transport, in amounts that are low or comparable to the one to for examples Scandinavian countries, do become so concentrated in some compartments.",

Regin's poems find new literary ground, which again is essential in his effort to compose poetry within the literary trend , that arose after the turn of the century. In this effort he creates a personal, poetic languagc, which accentuates him as an individual rather than the trend that he is a part of. Regin's models are the poets, J.H.O.Djurhuus, H.A.Djurhuus and Christian Matras, who were the first to distance themselves from the nationalistic song writing, and who considered poetry as individual pieces of art. These poets, each in their own way, have all influenced Regin Dahl.\r\nThe language in Regin's poetry is created in his constant interaction with the very essence of his being, since he is in the unique position to have had a solid education, as a child, in both the Faroese language as well as cultural heritage. At the same time, the language in his poetry is also inspired by and dependent on the modern literary environment that surrounds him in his everyday life.\r\nIn the article the word modem is used in stead of the word modernistic. Today the latter is subject to various interpretations, and the governing and infeasable position it has held in poetry for half a century is frequently questioned. The word modern has a wide range of meanings, but is here identified with what finds new ground in close interaction with the literary trends of its own time.",

The sites normally contained archaeological structures and typically had place-names featuring the Old Irish element \u00e1irge attached to them. The whole concept of shielings as part of the early Faroese farming economy was reassessed by Ditlev L. D. Mahler during the 1980s, and he produced a distribution map of these sites. No shielings were noted in the outer Nor\u00f0uroyar on this map. In 2001, however, such a site was recorded on Fugloy.",

Large-scale knitting dominated the export from the Faroes during the I7th and 18lh centuries and may be the reason why the more time-consuming nalbinding technique did not survive. An interpretation of a passage in Tarnovius might, however, indieate that nalbinding was still used in the Faroes in the I7th century. No textile artefacts support this conclusion, and the evidence in the source is weak, so the passage in Tarnovious must be treated with much care.\r\nAlthough the needles for nalbinding are simple in their construction, they do have a specific and recognisable form. The needles in the collection of F\u00f8roya Fornminnissavn from Kv\u00edv\u00edk and Tj\u00f8rnuv\u00edk may confirm the conclusion that nalbinding was known earlier in the Faroes.",

Impressions of nature have been intemalized and metaphorized in his poetry. The Faroese scenery frequently is the point of departure of his poems, but he extends his perspective from the experience of contrasts and shifts in nature to glimpses of a vision of a universal entity. The poet's attitude towards the powers of nature may be close to those of a mystic. The creating forces in nature are identical with the creating forces in the poet.\r\nThe poetics of Christian Matras may be found mainly in his metapoetical poems. The ideal poem should combine simplicity of words with power of thought through expressions which are adequate, pregnant and suggestive. A poem should be be firm and profound like a rock in the sea and transparent and complete like a dewdrop. Metapoetical poems from \u00darsj\u00f3n og \u00farminni (1978) convey ideas of what the poet claims a poem should be, and nearly all the short poems from Christian Matras' last collection demonstrate his poetical theory.",

Most of the autumn resightings of marked individuals (n=45) were malebiased and made &amp;lt; 2 km from the ringing site and on the same island. One individual (ringed as fledgling) dispersed at least 50 km, passing islands and waterbarriers. For male breeders return rate across years and areas was 61.5% (n=26), which implies a high degree of philopatry. The minimum annual survival suggests a significantly higher survival rate than shown by ringing recoveries of mainland wrens. Mean life expectancy of breeding males (i.e. at least one of age) was 2.1 years and two males bred for at least 4 consecutive years following ringing. For female breeders overall return rate was 15.0% (n=20). For fledglings 10.2% (n=88). Among fledglings significantly more males than females (assuming an equal sex ratio) returned to natal areas. In males, first-time breeders were significantly less succesful in obtaining mates than older ones. Possible explanations for the sex-biased dispersal patterns are discussed. No differences between areas or years were discernible, possibly due to very small sample sizes.",

The colonization began in the mid-1930s and the subsequent spread is described on the basis of previously published records, interviews with local people, and recent surveys of all habitations. Spatio-temporal pattern of spread is complex lending support to previous suggestions of possible, independent immigrations. It is suggested that the process of spread was influenced by the agency of man, geographical isolation (water-barriers and topography), and local conditions and population dynamics. Until now 80 % of the settlements (n = 118) have been more or less permanently colonized: first the larger ones (nearly all before 1960) and within 30-40 years c. 50% of those currently colonized (65% in the early 1980s).Total breeding population in 2001and 2002 was estimated at c. 2,500 and 2.700 pairs, respectively; one-third being recorded in the capital T\u00f3rshavn (90 pairs/km2). The numbers (total and local) have fluctuated (though preeise historical data are scarce) but currently no trend is discernible.",

In order to describe the distribution of plant communities along altitudinal gradients, five mountains were studied. The aim was to define vegetation zones and to determine the transition boundary between temperate and arctic-alpine vegetation. The vegetation was classified into 12 plant communities belonging to four main vegetation types. These types are open grassland vegetalion, Racomitrium vegetation, moist grassland vegetation, and moist dwarf shrub vegetation.\r\nThree significantly different altitudinal vegetation zones can be defined: a temperate zone (upper limit at 200 m a.s.l.); a low alpine zone (200-400 m a.s.l.); and an alpine zone (above 400 m a.s.l.). The temperate zone is characterized by moist dwarf-shrub heath vegetation with these two plant communities: Empetrum nigrum-Calluna vulgaris community and Calluna vulgaris-Nardus stricta community; the low alpine zone is characterized by moist grassland vegetation with these three plant communities: Thymus praecox-Vaccinium myrtillus community, Nardus stricta-Potentilla erecta community and Galium saxatilis-Anthoxanthum odoratum community; and the alpine zone is characterized by two types of vegetation: 1) Racomitrium vegetation with these three plant communilies: Racomitrium lanuginosum community, Racomitrium lanuginosum-Salix herhacea community and Racomitriumfasciculare-Alchemilla alpina community; and 2) open grassland vegetation with these four plant communities: Koenigia islandica community, Festuca vivipara-Agrostis capillaris community, Bistorta vivipara-Festuca vivipara community and Deschampsia flexuosa-Rhytidiadelphus loreus community. I conclude from this study that the three vegetation zones are found at considerably lower altitudes than older studies demonstrated.",

The cases are compared in relation to their possible socio-economic effects in practice in fisheries. Possibilities are investigated on three levels: On the macro-level, it is discussed what does the legal status of regions mean to transnational cooperation. On the meso-level, the article investigates cooperation in resource management, processing and tnarketing in fisheries. And on the micro-level, it is discussed how innovative regions emerge. The empirical material has its main focus on the early and mid 1990s.",

This attitude has changed in recent years and this has resulted in a wide vocabulary range in the Faroese dictionaries. It has become evident that there is a tendency to allow a larger number of words conlaining affixes of non-Norse origin in Faroese dictionaries.

The high relief of the Faroes enables the study of the altitudinal climate gradient. Close to sea level the climate is cool temperate or subarctic, grading into a low arctic climate around 200 m asl. To initiate collection of data representing the mountain meteorology the first meteorological station above 300 m asl was established at the Sornfelli mountain measuring at 722 m asl in 1999. The Somfelli meteorological station is based on innovative technology with the instruments only periodically exposed from a heated cylinder, protecting them from strong winds and icing conditions.\r\nThe station is operated automatically with modem access. The Sornfelli meteorological station has proved successfull achieving 95% data coverage in 2000. Mean annual air temperature (MAAT) in 2000 at Sornfelli was 1.71\u00b0C. Mean annual wind speed was 6.5 m/s. Dominating wind directions were from southwest, southeast and north. The annual mean lapse rate between Sornfelliand the coast was -0.0077\u00b0C/m.",

In return these beneficial soil fungi require carbohydrates from the plants. Although several plants are not able to or less dependent upon mycorrhiza, they seem to be less frequent than theplant species, which normally are mycorrhizal. There are different types ol' myeorrhiza, and some ol' them do not coexist. For example mushroom-forming mycorrhiza is rare on heathland. The most common type, arbuscular mycorrhiza, seems to coexist with other types of myeorrhiza. The data presented in this paper indicate that dual infection, where a plant is colonised by different types of mycorrhiza could be of importance in the Faroese mountainous vegetation.",

The species is widespread, occurring in Asia and Europe, e.g. in Britain (including Orkney), Denmark and Norway, but it is not known from lceland and Greenland. C. impunctatus, which is associated with bogland, was particularly abundant at M\u00fdrarnar. The mean antennal ratios (the ratio of the sum of the length of the apicalfive segments of the antennal flagellum to the sum of the basal segments) of Faroese female specimens was significantlylower than mean ratios recorded from Britain and Denmark, indicating smaller absolute body size. The species is an extremely persistent biter, feeding on man and large mammals. In the Faroes man, cattle, sheep and possibly the arctic hare are potential hosts. The feeding on livestock may cause considerable distress, in cattle hypersensitivity to the bites may develop and in horses the biting may give rise to an allergic dermatitis. The record of C impunctatus adds a troublesome biting fly to the Faroese fauna.",

    "abstract": "According to a brief comment in J.C. Svabo's travelogue, the snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) was considered among the Faroese to make a delicious repast. The snow bunting appeared in abundance during springtime in the villages; it was probably at this time that it was captured for food. However, evidence from the Faroe Islands concerning its use is sparse. According to many records from elsewhere, however, the snow bunting was considered a fat little bird that could be caught during its northern springtime migration, when it passed through northern Scandinavia, Greenland, Russia, Siberia, and North America. People in the subarctic region caught it in large numbers (usually in snares) and used it as food. It was also kept as a cage bird. Children in Greenland even used it as a kind of toy. According to an account from N\u00f3lsoy at the end of the 19th century, the snow bunting was captured in primitive enclosure traps. Although we lack detailed data on the methods used for trapping this bird in the 18th century, Svabo's sparse account is a plausible one.",

    "abstract": "This article explores a linguistic anomaly in Faroese that may be referred to as &quot;reversed&quot; pronunciation or a &quot;hyper-correct&quot; form. It is found in the dialect of Tj\u00f8rnuv\u00edk, a small village situated in the north of the island of Streymoy. Faroese employs glide insertions between two adjacent vowels. The glide insertion depends on the phonetic environment. As a consequence of these glides, which are j , v, and w, a monophthong in the stem can be pronounced as a diphthong, e.g. hagar as [hei:jaj]. The resultof this pronunciation is a syncretism of words with original &amp;lt;ey&amp;gt; and original &amp;lt;a&amp;gt;, e.g. hagar and heygar in some Faroese dialects. This is the situation in Tj\u00f8rnuv\u00edk. The inhabitants in Tj\u00f8rnuvfk feel pressure from the surrounding dialects, which have the &quot;right&quot; pronunciation for these types of words. When one cannot hear any difference between these two categories of words, people begin to mingle pronunciations. The result is sometimes a false etymologization, and, thus, one can hear forms like [fle:a] forfleyga and [de:ajj for dey\u00f0ar.",

    "abstract": "The article analyses the play, \u00c1lvaleikur, written by the Faroese poet and author, Hans Andrias Djurhuus, and also presents a short review of romanticism in Faroese literature.\r\nAlvaleikur is a fairy tale play that takes place on two levels: people act in a &quot;play&quot; written by the elves without knowing that they are being &quot;directed&quot; by the elves. The play sets two worlds against one another: one representing harmony with the universe, the other alienating materialism. The article chiefly discusses the constellation of characters and their defining qualities. The play is deemed to be consistent with or represent a &quot;world-consciousness&quot; perspective, as articulated by Age Henriksen.\r\nEssentially, Faroese romanticism covers a period dating from the early 19th century until the Second World War. Compared to European romanticism, Alvaleikur (1930) is a fairly late work. One must bear in mind, however, that the economic reality within the Faroese community during the 20lh century ranged from the primitive agrarianism of the Middle Ages to complexindustrialism. It is, therefore, no wonder that Faroese literary currents such as romanticism, realism, naturalism, and modernism could be found side by side.",

The heath vegetation is very mixed with many grasses, herbs and mosses. The most dominant vegetation in the FaroeIslands is grassland vegetation, found from sea level to mountaintop. Three types of mires are found in the Faroe Islands, topogenic, soligenic, and ombrogenic. Raised bogs are not found.

The main goal of this investigation was to gain knowledge of and to compile a complete taxonomicfaunistic overview of the marine benthic fauna in Faroese waters. In the initial BIOFAR programme (BIOFAR 1), samples were obtained from approximately600 sites located primarily at depths between 100-1000 m, with some as deep as 2420 m. A subsequent investigation focused on the shoreline and shallow waters. In the years 1995-1999, samples were taken from 872 stations covering the upper shoreline down to 100 m. This programme, run under the name BIOFAR 2, was lead by a steering committee consistingofTorleiv Brattegard, University of Bergen; Jon-Arne Sneli, University of Trondheim; Ruth Nielsen, University of Copenhagen; Karl Gunnarson, Marine Research Institute, Iceland; Ole S.

    "abstract": "Faroe Plateau cod spawn mainly in two areas that lie close inside the tidal front that surrounds the Faroe Shelf. Eggs and larvae are advected in an anticyclonic direction around the Islands. Peak spawning is in the second half of March, and, thus, the majority of cod larvae start feeding in April. At this time, secondary production on the central shelf is still at a low level. However, over-wintered Calanus finmarchicus, which are advected from offshore onto the northern and western slope and shelf regions may spawn by April. Observations from April 1995 and 1999 showed that the firstfeeding cod larvae fed mainly on copepod eggs, which, based on their sizes, are presumed to be mainly C. finmarchicus eggs. Copepod nauplii were only of minor importance. The spawning areas of Faroe Plateau cod are close to the areas with the highest average egg productionof C. fmmarchicus during early spring. This results in a coherent advection of cod eggs, larvae, and food from the spawning ground. They are advected clockwise, in an easterly direction, onto the northern shelf region and are then dispersed throughout the central shelf area. As the cod larvae grow, they switch over to larger prey. Food observations in late May 1995showed mainly a mixture of copepod nauplii, young copepodites of C. finmarchicus, and various neritic copepod species (mainly Acartia and Temora), which were produced on the shelf during spring.",

Current and tidal amplitude had minor effects. No effects were detected from slope, aspect, or local protection. The results alsoindicated the presence of an unknown factor responsible for some of the variation. The biological exposure scale, which was developed by Bruntse et al.

In the winter, spring, and autumn of 1999, faecal samples were collected from 226 lambs and ewes and were searched for the presence of nematode eggs, Eimeria oocysts, lungworm larvae, and Fasciola eggs. Ectoparasites found in connection with these examinations were also noted. The studies confirm that the following parasites are present in and on sheep in the Faroe Islands. Nematodes in the abomasum: Teladorsagia circumcincta, T. trifurcata, T. davtiani and Trichostrongylus axei.Nematodes in the small intestine: Trichostrongylus vitrinus, Nematodirus battus, and N.filicollis. Nematodes in the large intestine: Chabertia ovina, Oesophagostomum venulosum, and Trichuris ovis. Nematodes in the lungs: Dictyocaulus filaria and Muellerius capillaris. Cestodes in the small intestine: Moniezia expansa. Cestodes in the abdominal cavity: Cysticercus tenuicollis (Taenia hydatigena). Coccidia in the small intestine: Eimeria spp. Flukes in the liver: Fasciola hepatica. Ectoparasites:Bovicola ovis and Melophagus ovinus. There are significant reasons to believe that Psoroptes ovis is also present, although it was not found in this study. It is anticipated that these parasites would have a great impact on the health of the sheep in the Faroe Islands, if proper management and medication were not performed. The results of this project contribute to an overall understanding of the parasite population in and on sheep in the Faroe Islands, although extensive study is needed in the future to get a more detailed understanding of the parasite complex and of the epidemiology of the same parasites.",

In the Faroe Islands, Norway and northern Sweden, this belief legitimised local aversion to the eelas food.\r\nStrange looking fish, either exceptionally large specimens of a certain species or those that were malformed in one way or other, or even uncommon species caught together with fish shoals, have been regarded as kings or leaders of certain fish. They have also been called -styrja in the Scandinavian languages. In Nordic countries, this term denoted certain large and rare fish species which were believed to command and protect other fish species such as herring or mackerel, which appear inlarge shoals along the Atlantic coast, e.g. the opah (Lampris guttatus), the oarfish (Regalecus glesne), and the tuna fish (Thunnus thynnus).\r\nThe tradition of regarding certain species or specimens as the king of other fish is widespread, not only in northern Europe, but also in other parts of the world.

A significant response to wave exposure was obtained for Aglaothamnion sepositum, Alaria esculenta, Corallina officinalis, Fucus distichus ssp. anceps, Himanthalia elongata, Mastocarpus stellatus, Polysiphonia stricta and Porphyra umbilicalis, predominantly found on exposed shores; for Ascophyllum nodosum, Cladophora rupestris, Pelvetia canaliculata,Verrucaria mucosa, Littorina obtusata and Nucella lapillus, predominantly found on sheltered shores; and Semibalanus balanoides, with the greatest abundance&amp;nbsp;on moderately exposed shores. A biological exposure scale was developed for the area based on the response curves for these 15 species. The scale is valid for rocky shores in the Faroe Islands with mean tidal amplitude larger than 0.40 m, and can be used to account for the distribution of dominant and frequently occurring species in the littoral zone. This is supplemented with diagrams illustrating the vertical distribution and abundance of species at localities selected to represent different wave exposure. Our studies confirm the descriptions of the distribution of littoral organisms in earlier works about the Faroe Islands. Compared to the British Isles and the south-west coast of Norway, the most strikingdifferences are fhe abundant growth of Laminaria digitata and Alaria esculenta on sheltered shores, the lack of dense populations of Fucus serratus and the frequent occurrence of many species over the whole exposure range.",

The identification of several new sites with the Vedde Ash in south Sweden has increased the known distribution of this important marker horizon significantly.

Several mountain tops are partly mantled by sheets of aeolian deposits. As the modern Faroese climate is dominated by strong winds, the presence of highland aeolian deposits is obvious. Their characteristics have, however, not been described earlier, whereas they are recognised in similar, neighbouring highland areas of NW Scotland. This paper preliminarilydescribes the geomorphology of the Faroese highland aeolian deposits, and discusses the further use of these deposits in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions.",

The palaeobotanical evidence for settlement is a significant increase in macrofossils of weed species, appearance of Hordeum-type cereal pollen, decrease in shrubs and Cyperaceae and increase in Gramineae pollen. These indicate crop cultivation as well as a major shift in the local vegetation. The exact dating of this phase however, is hampered by the coincidental occurrence of a radiocarbon plateau. The calibrated age range in calendar years, is in the mid AD 700s (age range AD 675-861, 1 G variation), making high resolution dating of this event difficult using the radiocarbon method alone. Several microscopic tephra horizons were observed above the settlement horizon. These included at least one geochemically defined shard from the basaltic phase of the so called 'Landn\u00e1m' tephra. Several tephras occurring around the time of settlement have been geochemically identified in the Greenland Ice Cores and have the potential of increasing the dating precision of this important event.",

Excavations in the 1980s revealed four buildings, thousands of finds and radiocarbon dates which extend back to perhaps the 9th century AD. This is the first complex farmstead of the Viking Age landn\u00e1m settlement to have been completely excavated in the Faroe Islands. Organic remains from floor layers were subjected to pollen and insect analyses in an effort to reconstruct land use associated with the farm and thewiderlandscape. The taphonomy of the deposits and their contained fossils presents diff\u00edculties for the interpretation of results.It is clear, however, that a mainly open landscape was associated with a largely pastoral economy, but cereal-type pollen is also present. The insect faunas are enigmatic in showing a very muted anthropogenic signature, yet one which displays obvious signs of anthropochorous habitats. Future palaeoecological research will include the investigation of many more samples and the analyses of seeds.",

    "abstract": "Saksunarvatn ash derives from an Icelandic source (eruption ca. 8930-9060 BP) in part of the Grimsvotn complex. The massive nature of the deposit as found in Faroese sites (up to 45 cm in thickness) might be expected&amp;nbsp;to have had an impact on the vegetation. The thickness of the ash layer, however, is contingent upon site catchment processes of erosion and sediment focusing. Even so, the tephra could still have resulted in changes to vegetation and this is examined by high resolution palynology at sites from different islands (Streymoy and Su\u00f0uroy), where tephra thicknesses of 1.0-6.7 cm respectively were found. Comparisons are also made with the pollen data from Saksunarvatn and Hovi (also located on Streymoy and Su\u00f0uroy) produced by J\u00f3hannes J\u00f3hansen. Palynological, and by inference vegetational changes consequent upon the fall of ash within the pollen catchment areas of the Faroese sites are mooted, with the strongest apparent effects at Hagam\u00fdra (Su\u00f0uroy),where wetter habitats may have become 'choked' with ash, thus diminishing the pollen contributions of associated flora. Similarly, the aquatic taxa are also reduced. Palynologically at least, and arguably vegetationally, this process favours dry land and taller taxa.",

The results of this are presented together with a re-evaluation of the pollen record, stratigraphy and radiocarbon dates from Lambi and adjacent sites. The possibility that supposedly anthropochorus taxa may actually have been present in pre-landnam habitats is discussed together with evidence for stratigraphic disturbance caused by burrowing puffins.

In addition, historical records suggest fallout may have occurred after three recent eruptions of Katla in 1625 AD, 1660 AD, 1755 AD, but this has yet to be confirmed with finds of tephra. The one basaltic layer currently known in Faroe is called the Saksunarvatn tephra, and was deposited about 9100 BP. It forms an important regional isochrone, that is present throughout the north-east Atlantic region. We report new geochemical&amp;nbsp;data on the Saksunarvatn tephra from the type site, and an older silicic tephra designated L3574. While the identity of the two youngest Holocene silicic tephras found in Faroe remains uncertain, we present geochemical data on two mid-Holocene silicic tephras which identifies them as the Icelandic tephras H-4 (3800 BP) and H-S (3500 BP).",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the link between the recession of Virkisjokull-Falljokull, an outlet glacier from the \u00d3raefajokull ice-cap in Iceland, and variations in mean air temperature. The glacier margin has fluctuated in response to climatic change over the past one-hundred and twenty years. Recession of the ice has revealed an extensive&amp;nbsp;area of proglacial foreland. Discrete, arcuate ridges and 'hummocky' ablation moraine are preserved on the foreland reflecting the pattern of ice-front fluctuations. Approximate relative dating of these features has been achieved using lichenometric data combined with geomorphic relationships observed in the field. Historical documentation and aerial photography have been used to construct the chronology for the latter half of the century. The glacier has not retreated in a uniform manner since the end of the 'Little Ice Age' cold phase. Recession of the ice-front has been interrupted by re-advance events on various scales. It is suggested that the twentieth century pattern of ice-marginal fluctuations corresponds with multi-annual trends of mean air temperature.Warmer periods resulting in rapid recession during the 1900's, 1940's and early 1970's; colder spells being responsible for re-advances in the 1920's, 1950's and mid to late 1970's. A lag in the response of the ice margin to temperature variation is seen to be approximately seven to nine years.&amp;nbsp;",

    "abstract": "The distribution of the Faroese vascular plants was thoroughly examined in the 1960s. We have used this material and conducted an enumeration of the number of species found on each of the 18 largest islands. The number of plant species found on the Faroe Islands may be demonstrated to depend on the area of the&amp;nbsp;island in question, in such a way that an island ten times bigger will contain approximately twice as many species of plants. Or to be more exact: The number of species (S) is proportional to the area of the islands (A) as indicated in the equation S = 73.8 A&quot;-2I).\r\nBy assuming that the distribution of plant species in the Islands is random, we have made a mathematical description based on the frequency of the species, a description which will by and large provide a better explanation for the number of species in the Islands. Deviations from this 'null hypothesis' may be attributed to other causes than mere dependence on area. The modelillustrates for example that the northern islands contain few species whereas Koltur is extremely rich on species.\r\nThe mathematicai null hypothesis also forms the basis for a comparison of the Islands' flora. The result is much information on the florae of the individual islands, for example that Sk\u00favoy floristicly is the most 'Faroese' of all the islands.",

    "abstract": "Organotin may be found as a component in some of the coatings that are intended for ships. The effect of organotin is to prevent growth on the submerged part of the hull, and thus keep the surface smooth. A ship with a smooth surface slides more easily through the water and therefore uses lesser amounts of fuel for propagation.&amp;nbsp;This same effect could be obtained with a manual scraping of the bottom of the vessel, but this takes both time and labour, hence the chemical way is prevailing today. Unfortunately it has appeared that certain marine gastropods, especially the dogwhelk Nucella lapillus, is particularly sensitive to the organotin species tributyltin, TBT. The response of the dogwhelk to TBT is the development of male sexual characteristics in females, a state which is referred to as &quot;imposex&quot;. In the most pronounced stage, imposex renders the female unable to reproduce.\r\nImposex has been found to be widespread in the more densely populated coastal communities and also along ship lanes offshore. The present paper desribes the levels and effects of organotin species in the littoral zone on the Faroe Islands. The results of the analyses of organotin species in dogwhelk, Nucella lapillus, common mussel, Mytilus edulis, and in limpets,Patella vulgata, are given. The abundance of the imposex phenomenon in dogwhelks collected at seven locations on the Faroes Islands is shown.",

    "abstract": "Cultural responses to the middle-range climatic changes may be of a various character which depends very much on the type of environment. However, this volume is concentrated on islands that were relatively isolated in the ocean which limited very much the spectrum of possible choices. Faroes, Iceland and Southern Greenland were settled by immigrant farmers/fishermen seeking improvement of their social situation by escaping from Europe where centralising processes of organising coerciveterritorial states started with devastating effect on traditional decentralised social organisation. Once they colonised North Atlantic islands and, subsequently, filled all suitable localities they were trapped in situation of no-return. They were too many to re-immigrate back to the continent and they were too many to change their economy to some less intensive energy extraction model. An important obstacle was also their hierarchical organisation that must have been based on surplus accumulation necessary for material manifestation of status.\r\nI discuss here those internal/subjective reasons that made impossible an effective adaptation to deteriorating environmental conditions. Especially interesting is the case of Norse Greenlanders who had an opportunity to&amp;nbsp;learn from the native North Americans but they did not take that chance. To understand it we must turn our attention to the ideological rather than material aspects of the Norse presence in Greenland. Decisive was their European culture tradition reinforced by Christianity.However, also some more practical aspects should be considered. The Norse were farmers and agriculture has such a strong impact on human mentality that there was no question of abandonment of agricultural land if there was no other similar locality available.\r\nThe extinction of the Norse Greenlanders, then, was due to the Christian ideology of farmers who tried to continue with their cultural tradition against any odds.",

The present treeline is close to sea level, and the potential present discontinuous permafrost level is situated 300-500 m above the highest mountains. Likewise, the modern potential glaciation level is presumably situated only 150-250 m above the highest mountains. During cold intervals of the Little Ice Age the lower limit for periglacial activity may temporarily have approached sea level, simultaneous with incipient establishment of sporadic permafrost in the highlands, and a number of sites in the highest mountains then were presumablyclose to reglaciat\u00edon.",

    "abstract": "The overwhelming importance sheep breeding has had in the Faroes over the centuries has resulted in the shepherds having perfected local or individual ways of identifying each and every sheep. The reason for this exact identification is due to the shepherds' interest in their stock, but also due to economic consideration. The extremely great number of sheep colours is a telling story to the interest the Faroese shepherds have had in knowing their stock intimately. Sheep colours still form an integral part of the description and identification of the sheep.\r\nThis article is based on the knowledge which the informant D\u00e1njal J\u00e1kup Mortensen, born at \u00d8rav\u00edk in 1921, has on the subjeet, and he is a reliable source with tremendous experience, because he has been a shepherd for more than fifty years in the village of \u00d8rav\u00edk, Su\u00f0uroy. The colours described in this article are his colours, i. e. the colours used in his village and which he has got from his forefathers who were also shepherds in the same village. Other shepherds in other villages have their own separate colour structures, names, and definitions which differ slightly or widely from the colour structure described in this article. Even within the vicinity of the village of \u00d8rav\u00edk the colour structures differ if only slightly.\r\nIn this survey all the colour combinations have been included which cover a reasonable and workable colour structure. It would be wrong to conclude, however, that colours are the only system applied to the description and identification of the sheep. Other charateristics are being used, e. g. the shapes of the horns, the build of the sheep, and the character of the wool. In order to show the reader how the outfield stock is actually being described we have included a survey of the colour structure used inthe village of \u00d8rav\u00edk where the informant was a shepherd and where his colour structure has been applied.\r\nAs an appendix the colour structure for the identification of geese has been added the way it has been used in \u00d8rav\u00edk. The colour structure of geese is also based on information supplied by D\u00e1njal J\u00e1kup Mortensen.&amp;nbsp;",

At last it is stressed that the excavation also accentuates the problem complex of farm-mounds in the Faroes.",

    "abstract": "According to the 18th century Swiss botanist von Haller, the Romans used water horsetail (Equisetum fluviatile) as a food plant. The author argues that this is a misinterpretation. There is no ethnobotanical evidence that water horsetail has been used for human consumption. However, the bulbs and shoots of the field horsetail (E. arvense) have been widely used as human nutriment. Faroese 19th century records show that it was eaten by people working the fields during the spring. From otherparts of Europe it is reported that it has been eaten mainly by children. E. arvense was used as a food plant also in North America and East Asia.",

    "abstract": "Samples of saithe, Pollachius virens, were taken approximately every second month, from Jan to Dec 1996. A total of 458 saithe (age 1-2 years and 3 singles 3 years old) were examined by pepsin-digestion and dissection for nematodes in the fillets and the viscera. For the 1- year old saithe the prevalence of infection in fillets and viscera of Anisakis simplex third stage larvae was increasing with time (from 40 % in May to 71 % in Dec). For the 2-year old the figures ranged from 18 % Jan, to 84 % in October (80 % in December), indicating an increase in infection with age and different levels between different age classes. The intensity of infection was increasing with time for the 1-year old, but appeared stable for the 2-year old. Similar patterns were observed for the intensity and prevalence of infection of saithe with third stage larvae of Pseudoterranova decipiens and Contracaecum sp., but the figures were generally lower than for A. simplex. The predominantly encapsulated nematodes Anisakis, Pseudoterranova and Contracaecum had almost fixed ratios among themselves, which reflects their stable environment. Other parasites found in the viscera were the nematodes Hysterothylacium aduncum (larvae and adults), Cucculanus sp. and the acanthocehpalean Echinorhynchus gadi. They exhibited a more complex and varying pattern of abundance and prevalence of infection, reflecting their unstable environment primarily in the gut lumen. A single record was made of the crustacean Clavella sp. (Laernoidea) and an unidentified plerocercoid of a cestode. The changes of the Anwafa'\u00ed-infectiorJ in saithe seem to have an inverse relationship with the changes of the primary production.",

    "abstract": "The dialect of V\u00e1gar and Mykines (hence VM) is spoken on the westernmost islands of the Faroc Islands. Earlier works on dialects - e.g.- Fter\u00f8sk Anthologi (1891) - regard it as a part of the dialect in Su\u00f0urstreymoy. In my opinion it better taken as a genuine dialect. The reasons are: diftongization and glide insertion in the structures 1) a/\u00e6-a &amp;gt; ei:a (hagan), 2) \u00fa-a &amp;gt; \u00e1u-a (f\u00e1a)and3)\u00f8-a&amp;gt;&amp;gt;'w:-a(kv\u00f8\u00f0a).(The IPA script is used in the article itself). Some other minor phonological features speak against grouping VM with Su\u00f0urstreymoy, especially the pronunciation of Old Norse \u00f3 as /eu:/ rather than /\u00e1u:/ as in Su\u00f0urstreymoy. More important - together with the diftongization an glide insertion - is, that VM has one special intonation sct called drynjing.The tone of a word at the end of a phrase is approximately as high as the tone on the following syllable. This intonation set has although nothing to do with the musical accent in Norwegian, Swedish and in Danish dialects. The drynjing is one of the reasons for very clearly articulated vowels at theend of a word. This has, in turn influence on the morphology, compare Su\u00f0urstreymoy ein st\u00f3rir vinir (nom. sg. mask.), tann g\u00f3\u00f0e vinirin (nom. sg. mask.), leir g\u00f3\u00f0e vinirnir (nom., akk. pl. mask.), eg vende (pret. 1. p. sg. ind.) vit vende (pret. 1. p. pl. ind.) and V\u00e1gar/Mykines ein st\u00f3rur vinur, tann g\u00f3\u00f3i vinurin, teir g\u00f3\u00f0u vinirnir, eg vendi, vit vendu. VM and Su\u00f0urstreymoy has thus different ways of expressing the content of some bound morphemes. Thedialect of V\u00e1gar and Mykines do not soften plosives between vowels and at the end of a word as in Su\u00f0urstreymoy, e.g. VM tak(a): Su\u00f0urstreymoy tag(a). W\u00edthin the area there are no mentionable differences, and the only change I have observed is that the younger generation do not have glide insertion and diftongization in word of the kv\u00f8\u00f0a-typc. Older texts (Svabo towards the end of 1800) fails to quote this diftongization and in the f\u00faa-type. There is a possibility, that they were not presentin the dialect at that time, but Svabo also fails to&amp;nbsp;quote diftongization in words of the hagan-type. It is only seen in hypercorrect writing with original Faroes ey /ey) form Old Norse au. This makes you think, that he deliberately is avoiding all.the diftongizations whatever his reasons may be. One observation I made, listening to the tapes, was a spirant g in lagdur. This can be the ON pronunciation of the g-sound in a protected phonological environment an just in one family, or an innovation. Following the development of the dialect from Svabo until today, there are rather few changes in morphology and phonology. One change seen durng the last years in VM is when youngsters confuse nom. and akk. pl. definite eg s\u00fa b\u00e1tarnar &amp;gt; eg s\u00e1 b\u00e1tarnir. This can be due to radio and television, which is very mush under influence of the Su\u00f0urstreymoy dialect, or just an inner change taking place in the morphology, so that the system gets \u00bbsimpler\u00ab.",

    "abstract": "Price and Assessment of Pilot Whales 1584-1638 The assessment of pilot whales is codified for the first time in the pilot whale regulation of 1832, although contemporary research workers consider the number of \u201eskinns&quot; (standard of value for pilot whale) very old.\r\nThis examination aims at analysing the amount of ..skinns&quot; in the pilot whale and its age. The appelations \u201egyllin&quot; and \u201eskinn&quot; refer to the Faroese monetary units of the Late Middle Ages up to 1790. Originally the number of \u201eskins&quot; was based on an evaluation that was built on the contemporaneous price level. But the price of pilot whale and the number of \u201eskinns&quot; have gradually drifted apart, and the number of \u201eskinns&quot; have become an abstraction which has no connection to the current price but which is founded on an obsolete price level.\r\nUsing the accountancy of the administrative officer in the Faroe Islands as the principal source, the entire information on the number as well as the value of all the pilot whales during the period 1584-1638 have been investigated and compared with the lawful distribution of the pilot whale catch.\r\nThe conclusion is that in this material we find a price level which is several times as high as the number of \u201eskinns&quot; that we know at the present. whereas the evaluation, i.e. the number of \u201eskinns&quot; of the pilot whale, is neither mentioned directly or indirectly. A conslusion, based on a statement of Lucas Debes (from 1673) which does not mention the evaluation either, ismade that the official evaluation of the pilot whale - and thus the number of \u201eskinns&quot; in the pilot whale - has been fixed during the period 1673-1709.\r\nDuring the years after 1700 the information on the lawful distribution of the pilot whale catch becomes more extensive and varied. Further research will make it possible to examine how the number of \u201eskinns&quot; is fixed, how the recognized ports for hunting pilot whales gradually are being united and how the notorious social equalization of the distribution springs up.",

The phytoplankton spring bloom developed in late Aprilearly May in the shelf water which was about one month earlier than outside the tidal front. The spring bloom started in the central and the northern part of the shelf. The limited water mass on the shelf - and, hence, also the limited amount of nutrients - affected the potential new primary production and around mid July 1995, allthe nitrate on the central and northern shelf had been assimilated. From mid July and throughout the rest of the summer, the potential new production was low and was dependent on advection of nutrients from outside the tidal front.",

    "abstract": "The Faroe Islands and associated shelf area, located on the western European continental margin between lceland and Scotland, are representative of one of the major Tertiary Igneous provinces of the North Atlantic region. Significant amounts of basaltic material was extruded over this area in the Paleocene, superimposing itself upon the preexisting geological structures and presenting a substantial barrier to geophysical exploration in the area, particularly as this volcanic material has notbeen penetrated by geological drilling to date. However, recent advances in geophysical data acquisition and processing in 1994 and 1995 have resulted in the production of new, substantially improved data sets which allow imaging of intra and sub basalt units in the more basinal areas. Further, shot records from these surveys have been analysed for their wide angle reflection information in order to constrain the velocity model for the overlying Tertiary section and to study the velocity behavior of the basalt units themselves. This will allow a greatly improved accuracy in the calculation of depth estimates for underlying units. This work has shown that, in certain areas, it is possible to seismically penetrate the basalt units present inthe Faroese offshore environment and define underlying geological structures. resulting in a greatly improved viability for petroleum exploration applications in the Faroese region.",

Architectural comparisons point out an influence from Norway and the dating - in the early part of the 14th. century - is based on comparisons vith Norwegian and English monuments. With that in mind bishop Erlendur is in the foreground as a supposed promoter for this monumental work.",

    "abstract": "A short presentation of evidence of an ancient food custom which does not seem to have been registered previously in the Faroes. In 1994 some bi-perforated sheep metatarsi were found during an archaeological research at &quot;\u00ed Uppistovubeitinum&quot; in Leirv\u00edk. These bones indicated that people have sucked the marrow out of the bones just as has recently been pointed out on the Shetland Islands as well as on Iceland. Close examination now displays the fact that this habit is known by certain people at some places and that it is actually still being&amp;nbsp;performed by at least one person: the hair on the sheep-'s legs was burnt off and then the legs were boiled along with the sheep's heads. An informant has explained that with a dagger one hole was drilled down through the upper end and one through the side by the bottom end of the leg. Then the upper end was put into the child's mouth, and an adult would blow into the other hole, thus the marrow emerged as soft butter. But the custom does not seem to have been described earlier in any literature on Faroese ehtnology or cultural anthropology, and few seem to know about it. Neither has the custom influenced the language except in a figurative sense. Now the custom has been archaelogically confirmed by the above mentioned excavation in Leirv\u00edk. There the custom has been dated back to 1100-1200 A.D., whereas last spring similar bones were found during an excavation at in &quot;\u00ed Reynagar\u00f0i&quot; at Tinganes in T\u00f3rshavn. Those bones were dated back to 1600-1700 A.D. Yet another cultural element has been confirmed wh\u00edch the Faroes have in common with their neighbours to the south and to the north. However, further investigation of this interesting phenomenon is required.",

    "abstract": "The most common and widely used explanation for the derivation of the Faroese word grind (school of pilot whales) elates the word's origins to grind with the meaning of a framework or gate-like structure. The application of this sense to a school of pilot whales has been popularly explained either by the formation of a school of whales as they swim together, or in relation tothe methods used to drive schools of pilot whales, whereby they are &quot;fenced into&quot; bay s by a line of boats to prevent their escape, with parallels in sheep herding activities. An alternative to this standard derivation is suggested, in which the word is rather related to the agitated behaviour and movement of whales within a group, as found in the seventeenth century Norwegian description of a Hvalsgrind by Peder Clauss\u00f8n Friis, as well as in Icelandic expressions such as a\u00f0 vera \u00ed grindum orgrinda sig, which refer to the shoaling and mating behaviour of groups of whales.",

The abundance for the different year-classes was 0-27third stage larvae. Left fillets of the saithe contained more larvae (62 %) than right fillets (38 %). The difference is statistically significant for the ventral parts of the fillets.

    "abstract": "'B\u00e1tsbandi\u00f0' is the common word for the old (unwritten) Faroese customary law system of keeping large fishing boats for winter fishing. Within this system certain boatowners had at any time at their disposal the requisite number of men for their boats. In return the crew had certain rights opposite the boatowner. After the introduction of the first Danish constitution in 1849, and when later the Faroe Islands got free trade, the system came into conflict with the spirit of the time, and in 1865 it was abolished by law. In the article the legitimacy of the system is examined. The source material points out that the origin of the system was connected with the landed property of the original farms, which in the course of time had been divided into 'b\u00fdlingar', i.e. groups of houses built on the building ground of the original farms, and thus we deal with a relict of the oldest customary law system of the Faroe Islands. In some villages the original boat keeping system remained until the day of abolition. In other places it was gradually adapted to the ideology of the Danish absolute monarchy 1660-1849, whose representatives dominated the Faroese administration of justice.",

    "abstract": "This article gives an account of the passbook system - a variant of the truck system - operating in the Faroe Islands from 1856 - 1939, i.e. from the introduction of free trade until the Second World War. This war brought about big economic and political changes in the Faroe Islands. The aim of the article is to explain the background for the origin of the system and to explain the system. The hypothesis is that the passbook system in the Faroe Islands should be regarded as a transitional phenomenon in the development from a kind of moral economy to a more developed capitalistic society. It was a system which undoubtedlystarted from humane considerations, but in time became an economic fossil - an economic straightjacket - which under the added pressure of the economic depression in the 1930s brought about the ruin of both employer and employee.",

    "abstract": "In 1992 several lepidoptera migrations were registrated on the Faroe Islands. A large-scale invasion of Plutella xylostella L. and Vanessa atalanta L. occurred around May 20 , which also included Pieris brassicae L. (2 observations), Colias crocea Fourcr. (one observation), Inachis io L. (4 observations), Aglais urticae L. (one observation) and Nymphalis antiopa L. (2 observations).\r\nIn early June a small-scale invasion of Cynthia cardui L. was observed. In September other long-distance migrants were found a.o. in light traps, including 2 Agrius convolvuli L. and I Mythimna unipuncta Haw., together with 5 Agrochola circellaris Hfn. and 2 Rhizedra lutosa Hb. The three lastmentioned species, C.crocea, P.brassicae and an introduced Pieris rapae L. are recorded from the Faroe Islands for the first time.\r\nBased on meteorological data during the period of invasion, the spreading of the species from Southern and Central Europe to the Faroes have been discussed. Field observations on the migrant V. atalanta after arrival demonstrated a distinct hill-topping behavior on mountain peaks 400-650 m above sea level. During the summer a strong larval generation evolved in many places with sheltered stands of Urtica dioeca. However, in August and early September only 9 indigenous adult specimens were encountered. A later increase in the Faroese observations was ascribed to wind-spread specimens from the southward autumn migration in Continental Europe.",

The measurements were performed at monthly intervals until the second world war and quarterannually after that. When combined with information on splicings after cable breaks the resistances may be used to determine average bottom temperatures of the water along the cable tracks. The long-term variations of annual mean temperatures may be doubtful due to occasional offsets, possibly associated with cable breaks; butthe seasonal variation appears more reliable and exhibits interesting features that may shed light on the behaviour of anomalous periods (Great Salinity Anomalies) in the Iceland-Shetland region.",

This number was further increased in 1990 by the discovery of J6G, the position of which indicates the possibility of yet another grave between J6C and J6G. Speculation as to the total number of burials is limited by the fact&amp;nbsp;that we have no idea of the site's northern and eastern limits. It seems fairly certain that the site continues under the old churchyard and a final estimation of it's size must await eventual excavations within that area. However it seems likely that the burial site is quite extensive.",

It has also been proved, that although the Faroese spade-form, the haki, may look relatively simple, it is in fact extremely well suited to reinavelta. The 'adaptational quality' of an implement can only be judged in relation to its function. Haki is an integral part of reinavelta. The scarce material would indicate a relatively late development of the rei'nave/\u00eda-practice. It is possibly an analogous form of the 'ridged field' cultivation practice, specially developed and adapted on the Faroe Islands.",

    "abstract": "In 1813 a Danish act providing compulsory training and state registration of midwives became effective in the Faroes. Nevertheless the majority of Faroese midwives were without formal training throughout the 19th cent. From the midwives' point of view, formal training and registration involved a more strict control by medical doctors and other officials, and their income was very small and regardless of their educational background until 1878, when they were guaranteed a minimum state salary, not least at the urge of the doctors, who also acted as protectors of skilled midwives. At the turn of the century, when the communications with the outer world were improving, a new generation of more selfassured Faroes midwives entered the stage who, inspired i.a. by colleagues in Denmark and a dawning trade-unionism in the Faroes began to organise and claim higher wages and recognition by virtue of their profession.",

At first the botanical survey in 1960-61 of Kjeld Hansen (1964) and his collaborators is mentioned, and the distribution maps which were one of the results of this work are discussed. Then 24 species found at one or more localities not mentioned in the distribution maps are discussed. 15 of these species were found at islands from where they have not been reported before, and one single species is new to the Faeroes (Heracleum pubescens). The reason why it is relatively easy to find species, that are not in accordance with the distribution maps, is discussed. It is supposed to be due partly to the investigation method used in 1960-61, and partlyto the fact that Kjeld Hansen carried out his investigations almost 30 years ago.",

    "abstract": "It cannot be claimed that the fossil insect evidence in any way detracts from the palynological record. It is possible that Irishmonks had so little overall impact on the landscape as to be undetectable in the entomology but, if the F\u00e6reyrar were the islands of sheep, it is surprising that they were without their dung beetles. It is possible that, if we were to sacrifice our onespecimen for an accelerator radiocarbon date (cf. Elias &amp;amp; Toolin, 1900), a different&amp;nbsp;conclusion would be reached but, presentlyPapar remain as elusive in the Faroes as they are in Iceland.",

The concept of identity is examined briefly, and examples are provided to show how such things as Faroese national dress, certain food, various old Faroese tools, wall decorations, advertising logos and so on have been transformed into peculiarly&amp;nbsp;Faroese characteristics. The last part of the article is a detailed analysis which shows how the pilot whale and pilot whaling have, since the early 19th century, become symbols of Faroese identity.",

    "abstract": "Originally there was no doubt about the language of law in the Faroe Islands. The language people spoke was also used in thecontext of legal proceedings. At some point in the late Middle Ages, probably around the time of the Reformation, this changed, and Danish became the sole language of law.\r\nWhen the Danish law of 1919 concerning judicial process came into effect in the Faroe Islands, the question of using Faroese as the language of law was raised. The result was that, in 1943, Faroese was recognised as a valid language of law, but on equal footing with Danish.\r\nAfter the Home Government act was passed in 1948, there was still no change in the status of Faroese as the language of law, and many years went by before the matter was discussed again. When the law of judicial process was last under parliamentary review, in the mid-1980's, the question of the language of law was discussed. This resulted in a change in the wording of article 149 in the law of judicial process concerning the language of law, such that it now agrees with the wording in the Home Government act.\r\nIn praxis this has probably not led to any significant changes so far, but it is nevertheless a recognition of the fact that theFaroese language should be used in the context of legal proceedings to a much greater extent than has been the case untilnow.",

The other school believed that the Faroese language should be cleansed of all non-Faroese elements, particularly Danish ones. Advocates of this view included Hammershaimb, J\u00f3gvan Poulsen and A.C. Evensen, but the chief proponent was J\u00e1kup Dahl, who gave Faroe Islanders the language of their church and bible.",

This article describes and discusses one ofEffers\u00f8e's collections of manuscripts, F\u00f8roya Landsb\u00f3kasavn (Faroe National Library) F XIV. In this collection there aretwo letters, fifteen poems or extracts of poems, and three plays. The existing manuscripts of Effers\u00f8e's first play, Gunnar Havreki, 1889, are also discussed as are some of the linguistic modifications made in subsequent publications, especially the 4th in 1934. The plot of the play refers to a tragedy which occurred at sea during the night between 24th and 25th November 1871 when a boat and its crew were lost.\r\nIn conclusion the article evaluates the literary merit of the plays written in Faroes a century ago. They are not regarded asgreat works in Faroese literature, but as to the evolution of the language it is considered very important that ever since 1889 ordinary Faroese dialogue has been heard on stage.",

(Up to 1986 when it was concluded. The author has later dealt with the subject in other editions).\r\nSecondly, an effort has been made to place the Faroese nationalist \u201eexample&quot; in a larger historical context, trying to make out what might have been unique and what can be considered general in the Faroese development.\r\nIt is important for the author to point out, as shown in the Faroese example, that it is difficult to present and to give reasons foruniversal models for the preconditions, the development, the organisation and the ultimate political outcome of a nationalistrising. The question is also put whether the forming of a state is always the logical conclusion of the awakening of a nationalsentiment in an ethnic group. In the Faroese example no Faroese never doubted his ethnicity and nationality.\r\nBut the outcome of the nationalist movement, organized in 1881 among Faroese students in Copenhagen and in 1889 in amassive movement in the Faroe Islands, did not result in the establishing of an independent Faroese state. Even if there was anelectioral majority for that solution in a plebiscite in 1946, two years later another electoral majority accepted a political statusfor the Faroe Islands as \u201ea self-governing community within the Kingdom of Denmark&quot;. This is still the outer constitutionalstatus of the Faroe Islands, although a tendency towards extended self-government is evident.",

    "abstract": "An attempt is made to distinguish between different phases in the immigration history of terrestrial invertebrates to the Faroe Islands and to estimate their relative importance. It is shown that a phase of large-scale immigration over the sea occurred some time between 10000 BP and 9000 BP, and that immigration by this means later became less important. Immigration by driftwood has probably occurred now and then; it probably started earlier from the American continent than from the northern parts of Eurasia. Aerial immigration has been important continuously since the islands became available for invasion; this process has increased in importance over time because of increased species richness in the main source areas in NW Europe. Immigration by agency of Man has taken place only during the last 1100 or so years; source areas have been western Norway, Denmark, and the northern part of the British Isles. Chance immigration of species with special habitat requirements has occurred during the human occupancy of the islands; examples are e.g. species that require deep soil layers, and forest-dwelling species in the recently established forest plantations.\r\nThe place of the Faroes in the North Atlantic biogeographic context is shown by a comparison between the occurrence offour groups (Coleoptera, Araneae, Lumbricidae, and Gastropoda) in the Faroes and the surrounding areas. Differences inspecies numbers between the areas are small for anthropochorous groups (Lumbricidae, Gastropoda); they are considerablygreater for groups where the main immigration has been by other means than by Man (Coleoptera, Araneae). For thesegroups isolation, island area, and plant cover are important, in addition to the respective species' dispersal ability.",

    "abstract": "From the appearance of fish with running gonads, and of pelagic eggs in the water column, it is evident that the Atlantic halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus, spawns in late winter in deep waters on the continental slope southwest of the Faroe Islands. Almost exclusively sexually mature specimens are present in the spawning area (mainly depths below 700 m), while inshallower areas around the Faroes, small immature halibut are quite abundant.\r\nTemperatures and salinities in the spawning area are, in February, c. 8\u00b0 C and 35.25%o respectively. A possible significanceof the cold deepwater current running north-westwards just north of the spawning area through the Faroe Bank Channel,as a clue for halibut to identify the spawning area, is discussed.",

During the first years it was mostprevalent on Su\u00f0uroy, Sandoy and Sk\u00favoy, and then later spread all over the Faroes.\r\nIn 1934 Arthur Rasmussen (later Vaag), a general practitioner in V\u00e1gur, gave a lecture in the Faroes Medical Association andwrote an article in the Danish Medical Journal, \u00bbUgeskrift for L\u00e6ger\u00ab, on this unknown infection, which he called \u00bbprim\u00e6repidemisk alveolopneumoni\u00ab.\r\nOn the basis of Arthur Rasmussen's article, R.K. Rasmussen, a general practitioner in Ei\u00f0i, embarked upon the collect\u00edonof the particulars of all the cases in the Faroes, which he then studied. In a lecture \u00edn the Faroes Med\u00edcal Associationin 1936, he came to the conclusion that this infection was psittacosis (parrot fever), and that the young of the fulmar(Fulmaris glacialis), which is caught in August \u2014 September every year, might be the source of infection.\r\nIn September 1937 it was established that patients at Dr. Alexandrines Hospital, who had died, had psittacosis. In 1938 thepsittacosis virus was found both in fulmar young and in Faroes patients who died in that year. Thus the mystery of the Faroeseepidemic was solved within a few years.",

    "abstract": "Until the Faroese sea fishing began in the middle of last century, agriculture was the dominant occupation. Sheepbreeding assumed an outstanding position, althougt it was carried on rather extensively.\r\nAlready in 1298 a special law for the Faroe Islands, Sey\u00f0abr\u00e6vi\u00f0 (the sheep letter) was passed, which among other points stated that \u00bbthe number of sheep to be kept on an area of pasture land shall be the same as it was in previous times, unless men see that it can accomodate more\u00ab. This figure, in the Faroese language called the sey\u00f0askipan (orjust skipan), expressed the carrying capacity of each individual location, and to this day, it is used as an expression of the optimum carrying capacity, for the various parts of the islands.\r\nThe sey\u00f0askipan has changed through history, generally with a rather marked decline since the seventeenth century, but the&amp;nbsp;development is characterised by considerable regional differences. It is the purpose of this regional study to judge, how the development of this optimum can be interpreted in a predominently \u00bbhuman-ecological\u00ab way, and to stress some socio-economic features of development, which are necessary to explain the development.\r\nSeveral circumstances have to be taken into account: Systematic errors due to false information in surveys and taxations; changes in the sheep race due to replacement of the stock after an extensive mortality in connextion with a severe winter (a socalled felli), which could influence both sheep size and slaughterpercent; generel trends in climatic variations and overgrazing related to these trends; changes in the territorial organization of the sheepgrazing system and especially the generel development from private ownership to the single sheep ('kenning'), to joint management of the sheep, and ownership based on the&amp;nbsp;farmers' share of the total value of the village - the socalled 'markatal' ('feli').\r\nIt is concluded, that a general reduction in the carrying capacity might be related to a climatic decline in connexion with, oreven making worse, tendencies of overgrazing. The influence of the change from 'kenning' to 'feli' is given high priority too,and is also evaluated as a factor which should lower the areal-productivity and the grazing pressure. The reasons for this development has however no ecological explanation, but has been social induced because of the growing fragmentation of private property. A lowering of the areal productivity due to this change is not supported by the regional analysis.&amp;nbsp;\r\nA slight growing productivity in the last century (measured as a growing slaughterpercent in a period of constant overall skipari) can be primary related to the introduction of drugs, which counteracts the generally declining efficiency in the use of the biological grazing potential, due to a steady lowering of the labour input.",

Three days later the overallmortality rate was 77% (27 of 35 metric tons). The cause of these heavy mortalities turned out to be the toxic dinoflagellateGonyaulax excavata. Since G. excavata is best known as a cause of PSP in mussels, shellfish from a musselbed just inside thecove were analyzed for PSP and shown to contain 9,000 mouse units PSP per 100 grams of tissue 14 days after the red tide.Presumably toxin levels were much higher in earlier stages of the bloom. Furthermore, four cases of PSP following consumption of mussels from the fjord were diagnosed retrospectively in the village of Trongisv\u00e1gur (2,500 inhabitants).",

The results for the rest of the year indicate a rather irregular diurnal variation in the wind power.Considerable seasonal and interannual variation is found to be in both the wind speed and the wind power.

For several reasons birth weights in the Faroes and in Demark are highly comparable.

Standardizations with respect to maternal age, marital status and the number of previous pregnancies does not change the difference between the twopopulations' averages significantly. A less active elective delivery in the Faroes was not explanatory. There was not any difference in the sex ratio of newborn infants or in the frequency of twins in the two countries, and the prevalence of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the Faroes is half that in Denmark.

    "abstract": "The Faroe Islands from about 1900 to the Second World War. A report on an ethnological survey. In 1975 the Faroese Museum embarked on an extensive project in order to collect information on life and conditions in the Faroe Islands, from the turn of the century up to the Second World War. Questionnaires were sent out, and tape recordings made of interviews. Of primary importance in the gathering of this information was a fourteen-page questionnaire, of which 858 copies were sent out and 175 were completed and returned. This gives a reply rate of 20%, which must be regarded as reasonable for this type of survey. Besides these replies, the survey includes material of a less structured nature. In all, 227 people have contributed information.The collected material amounts to 8500 pages. The report describes the actual work of collecting the material, the questionnaire, and how it was distributed. Finally, there is a list showing the topographical distribution of the material. Tables show the age and social position of the informants, and the number of pages per record. A map shows which villages are represented in the survey. The report ends with a short critical evaluation.",

A language advisory board, M\u00e1lstovnurin, was established in 1958. A book exchange arrangement was made with institutions in many countries, and thus a comprehensive and valueable collection of scientific literature was provided.\r\nIn 1964 the Society arranged the first course in Faroese language and literature for schoolteachers and other students. At the same time the Museum of Natural History arranged courses in natural sciences. The outcome of these activities was the foundation of an institution of higher education, and this was achieved when, in 1965, the Fr\u00f3\u00f0skaparsetur F\u00f8roya (Academia F\u00e6roensis) was established with the object of undertaking research and higher education. Today there are three departsments: the department of Faroese&amp;nbsp;language and literature, the department of natural sciences, and the department of theology.Nine fulltime teachers are responsible for the 2-year courses given at three departments. In this article the history of the Society and the Academy is outlined since their establishment.\r\nTwo men are regarded the pillars of both the Society and the Academy: Hanus Debes Joensen, dr. med., and J\u00f3annes Rasmussen, dr. scient. h.c.",

    "abstract": "The Faroese Word baraldur 'Juniper'In Faroese there are two words for 'juniper': one is einir (masc.) or eini (neutr.), with compounds like einirunnur and einivi\u00f0ur; the other is baraldur. einir belongs to the stem ein-, which occurs in the whole of Scandinavia, while baraldur looks like a Farocse innovation. The uncertainty reflected in the use of different names and forms due to the fact that the juniper is now very rare in the Faroes. It was formerly sed for several purposes, among other things for smoking meat and it is therefore nearly extinct. The word baraldur, which is probably a comparatively late aW-derivative (for which see Alexander J\u00f3hannesson in \u00c1rb\u00f3k H\u00e1sk\u00f3la \u00edslands 1926\u201427) to barr (OI barr, Norw. dial. bar) 'needle', is, as I see it, a noa term of the same type as bruse, brisk, brakje etc. 'juniper' in Norway (for these see O.

    "abstract": "By a decree of 21.5.1777 poor people in the Faroe Islands were forbidden to marry, unless they had a certain amount of land, or both partners had served four years with farmers on crown land. This provision is, by its nature, almost unique in Danish legislation, and was justifiably felt by the Faroese to be very oppressive.\r\nBehind the introduction of this provision lay the suspicion that the cultivation of corn in the Faroes was on the decrease, in that constantly&amp;nbsp;increasing quantities of corn were being imported. The large import was costly for the trader, the state.\r\nThe article points out that the cultivation of corn was not, in fact, decreasing, but the fixed rate paid for commodities since 1691 had resulted in a great increase in the production of hosiery, and the consequent increase in purchasing power had lead to a higher consumption of corn. Another result of the trade policy was that it was possible for poorer people to earn a living by knitting hose instead of working for the farmers. The decree of 1777 forced them back into the service of the farmers.\r\nThe matter was raised by the Danish government officials in the Faroe Islands, who, in a letter to the Exchequer (which was also responsible for agriculture) complained about poor people who wandered about begging wool. An inquiry carried out the Exchequer did not clearly reveal a decrease in the cultivation of corn, but the chief administrator's report to the inquiry establishes the decrease. The chief administrator also recommended a proposal from the government officials, a proposal which was almost identical with the provision which was finally laid down. The Exchequer's recommendation met strong opposition in the eqally powerful Chancery (administration of the interior and of justice). In the case, uncharacteristically,the Exchequer was the stronger, and the provision was put into force.\r\nThe way in which the matter was dealt with shows the powerful position of the government officials; it is, in fact, they who force the provision through. It is also the officials (the chairman of the Faroese Representative Council, the bailiff, the judge, and the church officials) whose advice is sought. In a similar situation in 1723\u201424 this was not the case. At that time the Exchequer negotiated with two men whose authority stemmed from a meeting of the Faroese Representative Council.",

    "abstract": "A 1:50.000 geological map of the Faeroe Islands was published in 1969 with a shortened English edition in 1970. It was based on strictly chronostratigraphic principles. A total sequence of 3 km of tholeiitic basalt lavas&amp;nbsp;was divided into a lower basalt series (about 900 m); a coal bearing sediment series (alout 10\u201415 m); a middle basalt series (about 1250 m) initiated by explosive volcanism producing agglomerates and tuffs, the tuffagglomerate zone; and an upper basalt series (about 675 m). Minor intrusions occur in form of dikes, sills and irregular intrusive bodies. The plateau has a low-angle easterly dip and the lavas of the lower basalt series are updomed in two areas, V\u00e1gar\u2014Mykines and Su\u00f0uroy.\r\nGeological and geophysical investigations were continued out on the shelf around the islands and on the Faeroe bank, Bill Baily bank and Lousy bank to the west.\r\nFurther geological information was obtained from two bore holes, one drilled in the summer 1980 at Vestmanna on Streymoy and the second in the summer and autumn of 1981 near the village of Lopra on Su\u00f0uroy (Fig- !)\u2022\r\nThe faeroese government organized, and was economically responsible for the drill project, which was carried out in collaboration with the Geological Survey of Denmark. The drilling work was entrusted to the icelandic \u00bbNational Energy Authority\u00ab (Orkustofnun). The drilling project was supported by the Carlsberg Foundation because of its scientific significance,The bore hole at Vestmanna was drilled to determine if the lower basalt series and the coal bearing sediment series from V\u00e1gar could be traced down dip below sea level as far east as Streymoy, and to get information on the regional thermal gradient.\r\nThe bore hoie at Vestmanna (Fig. 2) was drilled from just above sea level with full core to a depth of 660 m (Fig. 3). The coal bearing sedimentary series from V\u00e1gar was found at 556 m. Here it was 3 m thick and contained basaltic sand and pebbles, but not coal. The tuff-agglomerate zone did not occur at the drill site in Vestmanna.&amp;nbsp;The drilling continued 101 m into the upper part of the lower basalt series. The thermal grad\u00edent was 40\u00b0C/km.\r\nThe Lopra bore hole was planned to penetrate at least 2 km into the unknown sequence below the known part of the lower basalt series and to obtain further thermal gradient data. The drill site was located west of the village Lopra a few m above sealevel, as low in the known part of the lower basalt series as possible (Fig. 4). A section through the bore hole reaching 2178 m below sea level is shown on Fig. 5. Six cores were taken (one core lost) at different levels and cuttings collected for each two m drilled. The drilled sequence consist of about 120 subaerially erupted lava flows indicating a subsidence of more than 2000 m. The lava flows average about 20 m in thickness while the intercalated sediments are up to 5 m. The drilled sequence consists ofaphyric to feldsparphyric tholeiitic basalts and must be considered as a&amp;nbsp;continuation af the lower basalt series. The thickness of the total lava pile on the Faeroes is therefore at least 5 km and the early Tertiary basalt plateau on the European side of the North Atlantic, the Faeroe Islands, then reaches a thickness which is directly comparable with that on the East Greenland side of that ocean. The thermal gradient was about the samt as in Vestmanna.\r\nFinal scientific results will be published in Fr\u00f3\u00f0skaparrit (supplementa) in 2 years.",

    "abstract": "Statistics for the killing of pilot whales were collected from 1584\u20141640 and frcm 1709\u20141978. For the years 1641 \u20141708 there are practically no statistics. The statistics for 1884\u20141903 and 1963\u20141978 have not previously been published, and in the statistics for the other ycars certain corrections have been made. Table 6 shows the statistics for the years 1584\u20141640.\r\nFor the years 1709\u20141978 the killings have been examined from various aspects, and divided up according to period, time of year, site of the killing, and the size of the school. Fig. 1 shows the number of schools and the number of individual whales for each year; in fig. 2 the same numbers are averaged, and here a tendency becomes apparent. There are 100\u2014120 yearsbetween really good years. The years 1709\u20141978 are divided into five periods, A-E, in which each period is the consecutive number of years in which the number of schools and whales has been more or less at the same level. E is exceptionally good, A and C are good, D fairly good, and B exceptionally poor (table 1 and fig. 3). The distribution of schools in months and periods is shown in fig. 4 and table 2. A, C, and E resemble one another, with July and August as the best months (45\u201450 \u2022/\u2022), in D,August is by far the best month (51 %&amp;gt;); sudden changes occur from one year to the next, e. g. from 1962 to 1963 (fig. 5). The distribution of the killings according to sites is shown in fig. 6 and table 3, 67 %&amp;gt; of schools and 74 (l/o of whales have been killed at 6 sites. The sites have been collected into four groups according to the direction from which the schools have come, west, north, east, and south. Figs. 7 and 8 show thc distribution of killings in relation to these four groups, and the periods (A-E). There are many more schools in the west in D (57 \u00b0/o) in proportion to the other periods (17\u201432 'Vo). The annual average of the incidence of killings in the north, east, and south, is about the same. The distribution of schools according to sizc is shown in fig. 9 and table 4. Again D is outstanding, in 19 \u2022/\u2022 of schools there are morc than 300 whales compared with 7\u201411 \u00b0/oin A, C, and E.&amp;nbsp;\r\nThe factors which may possibly affect the incidence of whale-killings are considered. These factors are partly due to human beings, such as an increase in population, changes in occupation, and technological advancement (improved means of communication and the like), and partly to natural causes. There seems to be a correlation between climatic changes,particularly changes in the temperature of the sea, and the number of killings (fig. 10). Undoubtedly, it is the migration of the schools, rather than their size, which changes. Statistics from 1957\u20141976 (July\u2014September) indicate a clear correlation between the number of killings and the surface temperature of the sea south-west of Faroe (figs. 11 and 12). From 1966\u201469 to 1970\u201474 there was a climatic change (amongst other things in the atmospheric pressure and the temperature of the sea), and in the living organisms in the sea (plant and animal plankton and the like) in the North Atlantic Ocean. At the same time a change in the statistics for whale-killings is seen; the years 1966\u201469 resemble the good period E, while the years 1970\u201474 are more like the fairly good period D.",

    "abstract": "Between 1973 and 1975 an excavation was carried out at the former settlement Vesturi \u00ed Horni at Sy\u00f0rag\u00f8ta. The area is above the present village, about 30 metres above sea level and 200 metres from high water mark.\r\nThe total area examined is about 250 square metres. Altogether three sites were examined, sites 1, 2 and 3. 265 articles and fragments were found, of which 111 were potsherds.\r\nSite 1.7 X 3.5 metres at the middle. The site is so badly damaged that it is not possible to make any estimate of the kind of construction. All that can be said with certainty is that it was a house.Site 2.This is also a house which was divided into two, a main building 5.5 X 4 metres and a room on the west side, 5.5 X c. 1.8 metres dug down in the moraine. Consequently its floor is c. 0.65 metres lower than that in the principal building.Site 3.While sites 1 and 2 date from the same period, site 3 is more recent. It is divided into two. The room to the north is 3 X 3 metres inside and has a door to the west. The room to the south is 1.75 X 3 metres with a door in the south east corner, overlooking the village.\r\nAs there are two rooms, each with its own entrance and with no connecting door, it is obvious that this building must have served two different purposes.",

    "abstract": "The Norsemen's Valley in the garden of Fredensborg Castle in north-east Seeland is a big terraced circular bowl, laid out in the hills bordering the Esrom lake. In the center of the bottom is placed the column of victory, and on the two half parts of the concentric terraces were planted low cut trees. Between them were erected 57 Norwegian and 10 Faroese figures, mostly couples, representing farming people and fishermen from different parts of Norway and the Faroe Islands. 4 Icelandic figures were made but they have totally disappeared.\r\nAll the figures were in white painted sandstone (from Gotland) on small sandstone plinths (from Bornholm) with inscriptions in black. The whole complex was initiated about 1764 by King Frederic V (1746\u20141766) and completed by his widow queen about 1784. When she died in 1796 the castle was no longer used by the royal family and the maintenance of the gardenand its sculptures faded away. It was not until the middle of the 19th century restored to some extent.\r\nTravellers visiting Fredensborg in the end of the 18th and at the beginning of the 19th centuries have given different judgements of the artistic value of the valley \u2014 from disgust to praise. The view of praise is strongly confirmed through the latest researches. The sculptor was Johan Gottfried Grund born in Meissen in 1733. As an apprentice of sculpture he worked in Dresden and Berlin and in 1757 he arrived in Copenhagen, where in 1762 he was appointed royal court sculptor. Fascinating about his sandstone sculptures, all about 5Va\u20146 feet in height, is that he got his models, at least for the Norwegian part, from small figurcs&amp;nbsp;in walrus tusk, about 4 inches high, carved by a Norwegian postdriver, J\u00f8rgen Garnaas.\r\nAs models for the carvings the postdriver used some wooden dolls about 10 inches high each, which he himself has made and dressed in colourful peasant costumes. Some of the dolls and carvings do still exist in different collections in Norway and Denmark. Through these we are able to follow the work of the sculptor to a certain extent. It is thus pointed out by the Danish sculptor Eric Erlandsen that the sandstone figures are very close to their carved models and in several of them even the curving of the tusk is traceable.\r\nBut the legs, for instance, could not be cut free in the heavy stone and in full size figure, and therefore you find a fancyful collection of supports for the figure formed as rocks, trunks and different implements. The models for the ten Faroese figures are, however, not so easy to discern. For several reasons it is unlikely that they have been among the carvings of Garnaas.Nevertheless, the f\u00edgures show that Grund must have had an exact knowledge about the appearance, the cloth and implements of the Faroese people of that time.\r\nIt is therefore to be proposed that he got his information from one or another Faroese source in Copenhagen. One might have been the Faroese student I. Chr. Svabo, contemporary to the sculptor and eagerly interested in the daily life \u2014 and future life of his home country. As a task set by the Danish financial authorities in the eighties. I. Chr. Svabowrote his famous &quot;Report from a Journey to the Faroe Islands 1781\u20141782&quot;, containing an extent survey on all parts of the Faroese daily life, supplied with numerous drawings in colour. This report was delivered in 1783 and a year and a half later Grund did finish his work in Fredensborg. In provincial Copenhagen it is evident that the student, the postdriver, and the sculptor at that time have been associated with the same persons in the same higher circles. The aging of the figuies has now been in progress for more than two centures.\r\nSome reparations were made in the end of the 19th century but not until the 1950'ies a renewing of the two groups forming the entrance was necessary. The small trees have not been kept down in their original size, the higher they grew, the more shade they made in the valley and the more humid became the figures. Branches have fallen down and crushed projecting parts, and the iron clamps between the stone trunks have grown to a rusty foliage more than three times their original size, with new cracks for penetrating of water as one of the results.\r\nIn 1976 it became necessary to wash the whole complex, and this was done by the above mentioned sculptor Eric Erlandsen and his assistants. The report that followed is a thouroughly made inspection of each figure, in drawings and photographs showing the amount of destruction. More than one half of all the&amp;nbsp;figures was in a very bad condition, and one third of them was almost ruined.\r\nIt \u00eds proposed to mould the most destroyed ones and place the rest of the original ones in a lapidarium in an indoor atmosphere. It is also proposed to mould some of the best ones to get a picture of to-day of the best figures \u2014 to be related to the ones of the worst state of conservation.\r\nAs an experiment, Eric Erlandsen is finally proposing to mould \u2014 without retouche \u2014 and cast some of the best figures in a specially made concrete, and let the copy replace the original. A first example of this way of restoration has now been made of one of the last figures Grund made. The Faroese bride was moulded, cast and replaced in the valley in the early spring of 1980.",

    "abstract": "Folk beliefs and customs concerning cattle in the Faroe Islands.This article is mainly based on records of tradition at the Faroese Museum and the Faroese Academy as well as information from topographical literature. Most of the tradition material was colleced in 1967 and 1968. As in many other communitiesbound by tradition, many unknown factors are connected with cattle breeding. The traditional thoughts constantly revolved around good and bad luck.\r\nMagic practices and various customs were aimed at averting bad luck and securing, or even improving luck with the cattle.The article contains many quotations and is centred on topics such as the covering of the cow, calving, troll-rides and other supernatural beings, the first days of the spring when the cow was driven out into the fields, and finally on the milk.\r\nThe magic practice in connection with the covering was to ensure successful lertilization. Here, as on many other occasions, the evil eye and the evil tongue might have a bad influence. Auguries were taken to discover whether it would be a bull or a cow calf, the latter being the most desirable with a view to the milk production. The calving was by its nature a risky event; the first eight days after the calving were considered to be especially critical, and the cow was said to stand \u00bb\u00e1 oskb\u00e1si\u00ab. The first syllable is probably derived from the Old Norse word \u00bbh\u00e1ski\u00ab meaning \u00bbdanger\u00ab. So the cow was subject to danger during these days. This meant that a number of taboo rules had to be observed not to challenge the milking luck.\r\nWhereas the tradition of trolls milking the cow and riding on it were practically unknown in the material collected in 1967 and 1968, there is much evidence to be found in older records and literature. The various customs and magic practices aimed at misleading the trolls, e. g. by cutting a piece of the tail and placing it into the stone wall in front of the cow so that the trolls would not know which was the front and which was the hindquarters, or for instance by burning some hair on the back of the cow, sweeping its back with a broom, strewing some grains of salt on it etc. Eventually the cow was blessed by having a candlemoved around it. But also during the first milking days magic was practised, usually by putting various remedies into the milk pail. The first water given to the cow after the calving had to be lukewarm, and some embers were put into the pail. In the springtime, when the cows had been driven out into the fields, embers were iaid by the doorstep of the cowhouse, which the cow had to cross.&amp;nbsp;\r\nMany of the practices carried out in connection with the calving and the first time ourdoors for the cow resembled each other closely. The milk had the greatest economical value. Precautions had to be taken not only in the critical 8 days, but also during the daily milking and when using the milk. Thus milk must not boil over. Most dreaded, however, were the evil eye and the evil tongue, which might do harm to the milk. The magic practice in this connection sought to prevent strangers from looking into the milk pail or entering the cowhouse, and it was important to milk so noiselessly that it was not audible outside the cowhouse. Thus, the threats to the cattle were all the unknown and undefinable perils lurking about, supernatural beings and the envy of other people.",

    "abstract": "The article deals with the interpretation of a minor archaeological examination of some traces in the walls in the parish church of Kirkjub\u00f8ur, one of the three medieval churches in the village. The examination suggested that this church must have been the result of one single plan.\r\nEmphasis is placed on its characteristic proportions \u2014 the church building being very long and narrow. Traces of pannels in the walls of the eastern half of the church suggest that the pannelled choir and the nave had exactly the same proportions, and it is concluded that the church has been dividcd at the middle, probably by a wooden panel, too. The author concludes that the parish church must originally have been designed as a bishop's church.\r\nIn an attempt to date this church more accurately, an evaluation is made of the very few datable remains which were found during excavations carried out between 1963 and 1969. There is also a consideration of the connection between this church and \u00bbM\u00farurin\u00ab, the biggest of the medieval churches at Kirkjub\u00f8ur.\r\nIt is assumed that the parish church is the stone-church that bishop Erlendur (1269\u20141308) built and not the \u00bbM\u00farurin\u00ab which has hitherto been thought.",

How they were rebuilt can be seen from a map from 1710 (ill. 1.), but there have been various views as to how the buildings were situated before the fire. An analysis of the source material about the fire and earlier information about thebuildings on Tinganes give an indication of how the buildings stood in relation&amp;nbsp;to each other and to those which were saved. Some of these other buildings are still standing, and most of the others have been identified from later sources. How the destroyed buildings appear to have been situated in relation to those which were saved and to each other is indicated in ill. 4, and the conclusion to be drawn from the examination is that the buildings on Tinganes were rebuiit more or less on the same sites and constructed in approximately the same manner as before the fire.",

    "abstract": "This paper suggests that there is acceptable evidence for the continuation of Christian sculpture and Pictish writing in Shetland in the period 800\u20141050, which Professor Thomas did not consider in his discussion of the finds from St Ninian's Isle and Papil. Following her more recent excavations in Orkney Dr A Ritchie has reopened the questions of cultural and physical survival of the pre-Norse population in the northern isles of Britain, and of assimilation. A tenthcentury date has long been proposed for the Bressay cross-slab with its Pictish inscription in ogam letters, which includes two Gaelic words, and one Norse, and has uniquely : between the words as in runes. A fragment from Papil which clearly resembles tombstones at Iona should also belong to that century. So does the knot-design reconstructed in fig. 1, for it is only known otherwise from a group of monuments in Scandinavian northern England. Its use of little bosses is a link with the same area. Some ogam letters also survive on this stone.&amp;nbsp;\r\nFeatures of the sculpture from St Ninian's Isle are recons\u00eddered, and arguments put for a date no earlier than mid-ninth century rather than before 800, by comparison with Pictish sculpture in east-central Scotland and in Caithness. Although the fine processional scene from Papil is older, it may also belong to the ninth century. The writer agrees with Professor Thomas that, despite the representation of a monumental cross, it too is in the east-coast tradition rather than influenced direct from Iona.",

    "abstract": "With a view to nosographical studies a brief survey is attempted concerning the intercourse of the Faroese with foreigners in the period 1273-1856. Founded on critical studies of literature, one is compelled to assume that the Faroese themselves maintained the principal part of the maritime contact until the end of the 16th century. Up til 1619 the all-predominant part of the legitimate trade went via Norway (Bergen), from 1620 to 1856 via Copenhagen. The extent of trade connections with the British Isles and with Hamburg (Bremen) and Holland in the 14th and 15th centuries is as yet undetermined. However, towards the end of the 15th century a lively commercial connection existed with the above mentioned German cities and Holland. The myth of the Faroe Islands as a highly isolated community can hardly be sustained, perhaps with the exception of the second half of the 17th and part of the beginning of the 18th centuries.\r\nBesides the legitimate trade connections there have been a multitude of other contacts with foreigners. Pirates attacked the Faroe Islands in the 16th and 17th centuries, and later also privateers and freebooters, but any substantial communication with these intruders hardly existed. Foreign fishermen have frequently fished near the Faroes.\r\nScotchmen and presumably also Frenchmen, at any rate during the latter half of the 16th century, and Dutchmen from the latter third of the 17th century. These foreigners have had close intercourse with the population, and the Faroese themselves, no doubt, fished aboard some of the foreign vessels. By the end of the 18th century some German boats worked near the Faroes, also with Faroese people aboard. During the lst half of the 19th century numerous foreign ships fished near the Faroes, as well British, French as Belgian.\r\nWhaling, seemingly, did not bring about any considerable communication. Smuggling did bring about close contact (with Germans at the end of the 16th century, and from the first half of the 17th century also with British and Dutch besides Danes and Norwegians). The connection with Holland was particularly frequent and regular during the 17th and lst half of the 18th centuries. Smuggling increased until 1856. Transit trade (England/America) in T\u00f3rshavn 1768-88 brought about close contact with foreigners. During the 17th century there were frequent visits by Danish/Norwegian warships, and at that time and later by Dutch, French and British naval vessels. After 1580 foreign officers were in command of the fortress of T\u00f3rshavn.\r\nSince the middle of the 16th century several Faroese have been sailing aboard foreign trade ships, often overseas, and have later retuined home. During the 17th and 18th centuries shipwreck occasionally caused considerable numbers of foreigners to remain for longer periods here and there in the Faroe Islands.\r\nTourist journeys were rare, but from the 16th century onwards several foreigners immigrated, and many officials travelled to and from the Islands (bailiffs, civil servants, higher trade employees, clergymen, doctors, and foreign landowners). A number of visitors, Norwegian as well as Danish, were married on the Islands. Young Faroese men and women went into service for a term of years in other countries. Some attended schools or institutes of higher education. Before 1620 all this took place in Norway, later in Denmark. As early as the 17th century craftsmen learned their trade in other countries. During the second half of the 18th century a few foreign coal miners worked in the Faroes. Several scientific expeditions to the Faroes took place both in the 18th and 19th centuries. A considerable contact with foreigners existed during the first half of the 19th century through fishing experiments and foreign trade on small Faroese vessels.",

    "abstract": "From the very outset the founders of the Danish Folk Museum were eager to have the Faroe Islands represented in their collections; in particular they wanted to include a roykstova (literally \u00bbsmoke room\u00ab, the living room in a Faroese house). Howcver, a number of years were to elapse before the right contacts were established with the Faroes. The Museum obtained a small selection of Faroese objects in 1888-89, but it was not until 1896 that a larger and more representative collection was presented by Captain Daniel Bruun. Efforts were then made to acquire a Faroese house, an objective which was partly achieved in connection with an exhibition in 1906, for which Faroese craftsmen constructed and furnished a typical roykstova and glasstova (parlour, literally \u00bbglass room\u00ab). Further efforts were made to expand the Faroese collection during the first halfof the twentieth century, and an active part was played in particular by A. Weihe and later Petra and H. A. Djurhuus in establishing cooperation with the Faroese Museum Association. Meanwhile, the Danish Folk Museum's most importantcontact and collector was R. K Rasmussen, who in 1920 was appointed doctor in the village of Ei\u00f0i. Over many years he acquired for the Museum a welldocumented representative collection of Faroese objects. He also assisted in the studies of the Faroe Islands carried out by the Danish Folk Museum in 1947 and 1949. A genuine Faroese house was not acquired until 1965, but that is another story.",

    "abstract": "Rognvaldur Sigmundsson, goldsmith at Fagridalur in Dalas\u00fdsla, Iceland, was one of those Icelanders of the 19th century who went to Copenhagen and learned the Trade of goldsmithry. He was born 1810 and died 1871. In the year 1828 he arrives at Copenhagen and becomes apprentice with Henrik Holm,&amp;nbsp;a master in the Trade of goldsmithry. He received a certificate in 1832 and in that year he went to Iceland where he became farmer and goldsmith. He is shown as first- rate goldsmith through various objects known to be of his making. Among things from his hand there exist two big cups of silver from the year 1828, an unusual produce among Icelandic silversmiths, a big soup spoon, spoons and a snuff-horn of excellent make which is in walrus tusk and furnished with silver mounts. Most of these objects are in the National Museum of Iceland but some are private property.\r\nMost of the objects which are known to be of his making are fashioned for the same people, the Rev. Eggert J\u00f3nsson of Ballar\u00e1 in Dalas\u00fdsla and his wife GuSr\u00fan Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir. They were wealthy people who cherished beautiful things and their home has possessed much silver. In Dalas\u00fdsla there were relatively more goldsmiths than in any other part of Iceland during the 19th century. This has no doubt been due to the fact that the district had at that time wealthy homes and families who had silver objects of good quality made for themselves. There working in silver even went down in families and it was not unusual that son learned from father. Silversmithry, however, was only an extra occupation, the main trade was always agriculture.",

Though the architectural history of the preceeding churches, mentioned in the written sourtes, is examined, it is not possible to give an exact dating of the churches, because written sources from the 18th century are scarce and therefore they can not be linked with the archaeological evidence. It is worth noting that because of the limitation of the research the excavation did not go as far down as to unearth older remains which were observed. Also it should be mentioned that burnt, heat-cracked stones are found in the western part of the cemetary whenever a new grave is dug and on the beach .south of the church, indicating ancient rettlement.",

    "abstract": "At F\u00f8roya Fornminnissavn in T\u00f3rshavn there is a carved Gothic figure of the Madonna (Figs. 2 and 4), which, though of exquisite quality, has received little attention from scholars. It comes from the parish-church at Kirkjub\u00f8ur, which inthe Middle Ages was the cathedral of the Faroe Islands. A closely related Madonna figure (Figs. 1 and 3) was formerly in the Svenneby church in Bohusl\u00e1n a part of Sweden which in the Middle Ages belonged to Norway. It has generally been&amp;nbsp;assumed that this figure (now in the Historical Museum of Gothenburg) was of English origin. The author of the present paper however argues that if one of the figures has to be considered as English, then it is more reasonable to choose the figure from Kirkjub\u00f8ur because of its outstanding quality, while the Svennebyfigure presumably is a Norwegian imitation. Wheen in 1959 the thick layers of plaster, which covered the Kirkjub\u00f8ur statue, were removed a thorough inspection revealed that, although previously cleaned, the wood still bore traces of the original painted surface, sufficient to give an idea of the statue's very colourful appearance.",

    "abstract": "In the article are discussed some modern Icelandic terms for a now obsolete method of preparing food from the blood of slaughtered animals. The blood was not mixed with meal but at least sometimes with tallow; it was allowed to coagulate, cut into pieces and brought to boil. This method was in use until late in the 19th century. The Icelandic terms for this are steinbl\u00f3\u00f0, augn(a)bl\u00f3\u00f0 and skyndilifur; their meaning and local distribution is discussed. A parallel method is known in the Faroes (at doya sveita); this fact seems to indicate&amp;nbsp;that the method is very old in both countries, probably from the age ofsettlement. It is suggested that the word bl\u00f3\u00f0mor ('blood-tallow'), still in use for black pudding in Icelandic and Faroese, is the original term, but after it became common to mix the blood with meal it was still called bl\u00f3\u00f0mor, while other terms were coined for the old method.",

    "abstract": "The core of this paper is a first presentation of a somewhat enigmatic object, found in 1967, on the small island of Papey off the southeast coast of Iceland. The object came to light during an excavation (yet unpublished) of what proved to be a 10 th century farm site, a fact well established by the nature of the buildings and the objects found, inclusive the one dealt with here, as well as C-14 tests.\r\nThe object is neatly cut from reddish tuff, abundantly available in the mountains on the mainland nearest to the island. It is regularly oval, convex on one side and slightly concave on the other, 8.5 cm long, 2.8 cm wide in the middle, and 1.2 cm thick where it is thickest. Near both ends there are neatly drilled holes, connected by a row of drilled dots running along the top of the object.&amp;nbsp;\r\nSimilar dots also run across the object. As a whole the dots on the convex side seem to be deliberately so arranged that they form three crosses, onc big and two small. On the concave side there is a lightly incised picture of an animal, a biped with a curved body, a spiral tail, and a long head-lappet or pigtail, which winds in big slings round the body. The animal is easily recognizable as belonging to the large group of animals on objects decorated in the Jellinge/Mammen style of the 10th century, although it lacks a good many of its well-known features (e. g. the double contour) because of its sketchy character.\r\nThe author finds it adequate to characterize the picture as an offhand sketch, and compares it to an improvised ditty, made on the spur of the moment. Neither the carver of a sketch like this, nor the author of such an improvisation, are likely to havelooked upon their work as a serious work of art, but for both it was equally necessary to be well versed in the intricate rules without which they would not have been able to create their respective playful products.\r\nWhat is the Papey object? Obviously, the immediate answer is a sinker. But the object is far too light and fragile to have been used as such. The best explanation seems to be that the soft coloured material tempted somebody to cut out the object in the form of a sinker, well knowing that it could not be put to practical use. Was the islandman perhaps making a toy for his little son?",

    "abstract": "This article seeks to interpret the place name Fleyggjarsteinur, the name given to a large boulder standing on the edge of the steep mountainside above the farm, previously the seat of the bishop, at Kirkjub\u00f8ur in the Faroe Islands. It is customary to fly a flag at this stone in connection with weddings and other solemn occasions. This is probably a fairly recent custom which may well have been inspired by a legend according to which the bishop was supposed to have his \u00bbmerki\u00ab at this spot.\r\nOn the basis of the first component of the name, which may stem from ON flaug \u00bbweather vane\u00ab) and the fact that at Fl\u00f8yfjellet at Bergen in Norway we have a name originating from a weather vane which stood at the top of the mountain for many centuries, it is suggested that Fleyggjarsteinur might have acquired its name from a weather vane which once stood there in the Middle Ages.",

    "abstract": "On a purely formal basis the name of the valley of Korkadalur on the Faroese island of Mykines can easily be interpreted as deriving from the Faroese word korki m., which in its turn comes from the Gaelic corcur (from Latin purpura). Korki (cf. Norwegian korke) is the name for the lichen used to produce a reddish colour in dying wool. This lichen grows on almost all boulders in the Faroe Islands, and is found in close proximity to all Faroese houses. It is therefore inconceivable that the residents of Mykines should have fetched their korki for dying wool from such an outlying place as Korkadalur. It is suggested here that the first component of the place name derives from another word korki m. which is common to the Celtic languages. This Celtic word, Scottish Gaelic corc, Irish coirce, Cornish ceirch, Breton kerc'h, means \u00bboats\u00ab (Avena). Korki meaning \u00bboars\u00ab is not otherwise known in the Faroe Islands, but it can have existed at one time, as it is found in a list of poetical names in Snorre's Edda (MS. from c. 1400), while on an 18th century manuscript from the Shetland island of Foula we find the expression Corca coust, which is interpreted as meaning \u00bboat bread\u00ab.",

In a commentary she has classified the folktales (AT + number) according to Aarne-Thompson's international system, The Types of the Folktalc (1961), and has given information about their relation to the local tradition. Collecting of folktales in former times has been done mainly by one person, the Faroese philologist Jakob Jakobsen, who was travelling in the islands for that purpose in 1892\u201493 and in 1898. Parts of his records, which are keptin the national library in T\u00f3rshavn, he published in Fxr\u00f8ske Folkesagn og \u00c6ventyr (1898\u20141901). In the fifties the author of this article made an inventory and classification of Faroese folktales, among which Jakobsen's collcctions made the greater part.At the same time she initiated the collecting of folktales of today by sending out questionaries.

The ballad was also recorded in Iceland as early as the 17th century (cf \u00cdFkv 14 and TSB D 94 Margretar kv\u00e6\u00f0i \u2014 Sister raped by brother is punished by father). However, even though it was first recorded in Iceland, the Icelandic ballad scholar Vesteinn \u00d3lason believes it to be originally from the Faroes. In my paper anothcr three Faroese variants (C, D, and E) are published for the first time. Variant C was found in a MS from the village Kirkjub\u00f8ur on the island of Streymoy, while D and E were recorded on Su\u00f0uroy. Of special interest is the last stanza (35) of variant E because it declares the foregoing ballad story as false. The aim of this paper is (1) to publish the new variants together with some information and comments about them and the already printed variants, (2) to say somethingabout the relationship among the five Faroese variants, and (3) to explain the nature of the above-mentioned last stanza of the E-text. In my opinion, it represents a secondary element of fairly recent date, created probably in the context of the dance by a competing or jesting participant more to tease the ballad performer (Far. skipari) than to discredit the ballad itself.",

    "abstract": "\u00bbHundaland\u00ab has long been known in the Faroe Islands as a skin disease in indiv\u00edduals who have recently been in contact with sheep. In the early 1970s it was identified as ecthyma contagiosum or orf. Tbe main objcct of the present paper is to describe the pathological picture based on information from medical officers in the Faroes. The estimated number of cases is 25 a year. The disease occurs especially in males, and is most often localized to the hands. Usually there is only one red spot, growing larger and ihicker. It usually heals in 2 to 4 weeks. Sometimes there are after-effects. Orf occurs most frequently in Octobei-December.&amp;nbsp;It is argued that a thorough investigation should be made into orf in sheep.",

On the other hand the various groups in the Faroes also had their special interests which were dictated by productionand consumption.\r\nIn 1691, at a time when the trade monopoly had been leased out, the price of wool had been f\u00edxed at a very h\u00edgh level, over twice the market price. At the same time, however, in order to limit the production of hose (which was far greater than demand), a quota system was introduced, according to which only a certain proportion of the wool could be sold in the form of finished goods.\r\nThe high price of wool made the trade unprofitable, but at the same time it was advantageous for the clergy and civil servants who had large incomes based on wool on the one hand and for the wealthiest farmers cn the other. But the poorer farmers and people who did not own land were most interested in producing finished goods from their wool; those without land also wanted a low price for wool, as they had to buy it.\r\nWhen, in 1709, the King took over the trade monopoly, the time was ripe for change, and both during preparatory discussions on the new charges of the 3rd May 1723 and in subsequent negotiations between Faroese delegates and civil servants in Copenhagen on changes in the new charges, the different interests in the Faroese community are clearly to be seen.\r\nThe result of the negotiations was that the price of wool was not reduced by so much as had originally been agreed; but this concession never took effect as plans for leasing the trade came to nothing, and so the civil servants came to the conclusion that there was no economic foundation for the concession.&amp;nbsp;",

    "abstract": "An anthropological and genetic survey of the Faroe Islanders was conducted with the aims of defining their characteristicsand comparing them with other populations of the North Atlantic region. Variation between subsamples of the populationassigned to different regional groups of the islands was also considered. This report presents the preliminary results of anumber of investigations. An anthropometric survey involving 17 different measurements on each of 155 young adult malesindicates that the Faroese are a tall, mesocephalic population, resembling Icelanders in a number of features. The results provide no evidence of notable differences of physique between subsamples from the different geographical regions of the islands. In contrast the dermatoglyphic study of 297 sets of finger prints indicates considerable regional differences in bothmales and females in pattern type frequencies and mean total ridge count. Pattern type frequencies are characterized byhigh arch and loop and low whorl frequencies, similar to but more extreme than those of Icelanders. Mean total ridge countis low, particularly so in the females. Skin colour as measured by an EEL reflectance spectrophotometer is extremely pale.Hair colour, as in the Icelanders, includes a higher proportion of darker shades than other Scandinavian populations. Colourvision deficiency was detected in 11 of 148 males and 1 of 126 females. Resemblance between the Faroese and Icelanderssuggests a similar ethnic composition, both are descended from predominantly Norse Viking populations which settled firstin the Faroes then Iceland in the 9th Century A.D. The results, not yet available, of the analysis of over 600 blood sampleswill provide more precise information on the relative biological affinities of the Faroese and surrounding populations.",

    "abstract": "From the time of the first seetlement until the end of the 19th century life in the Faroes was based on farming and its sidelines (fishing, fowling and the hunting of pilot whales etc.) which became linked together into an economic whole in which the produce was divided according to the rights of ownership or use of land. Therefore, matters of the land were decisive for all society and have, among other things, governed the process of settlement.\r\nResearch into place-names suggests that original estates of the time of settlement included several villages and, in some cases, whole islands. These large estates were, however, quickly divided up with the result that one estate comprised one village. Further division of estates formed several estates in the same village, but still standing on their own, and the foundation was laid for b\u00fdlingar. Chr. Matras estimates that this step was taken about 1300, while R\u00f3land H\u00f8gnesen estimates that by theperiod 1300\u20141400 only half the villages had been founded. Further division of the b\u00fdlingur-estaxes formed several farms (houses) in the same b\u00fdlingur, and Chr. Matras estimates thas this took place after 1600. The pattern of settlement in the middle ages becomes thus formed of scattered estates, one in each b\u00fdlingur. This corresponds to the usual archaelogicalconception of Norse medieval estate.\r\nIn this article I have endeavoured to show by the coordinated handling of archaeological, historical and philological sources that the above-mentioned division of estates must have gone ahead much more quickly thau has hitherto been accepted. In the Viking age we already have firm archaeological indications that several estates existed in the same village (i. e. that b\u00fdlingar had already been formed in the Viking age) and in a single case the possibility that several households lived on the same estatc.\r\nThe oldest acceptable documentary source material shows that by the 16th century the division of b\u00fdlingar into smaller farms had already come a long way and a similar example of division has even been found in a source from 1412. It is conceivable that the division of b\u00fdlingur-estatcs into smaller farms, which prepares the economic foundation for several houses in the same b\u00fdlingur, began early in the middle ages and was a direct continuation of the regular process which in the Viking age dividcdup settlement estates into villages and villages into b\u00fdlingar. This regular historical process was based on the system of inheritance in force, which is found justified in the oldest preserved Norse legislation, and is still today practised in Faroese villages where modern legislation concerning registration and division of land is not yet in force. However, in the middle ages, the Church, the King and foreign nobles, by appropriating land, hindered the inheritance laws from breaking upall Faroese land into narrow strips, as alloidal land is today.\r\nEarly in the medieval period these institutions had already begun to appropriate one estate after another. Such estates were not divided up any smaller than they were at that time, unless a direct administrative decision was taken concerning that matter. In this way, by the time of the Reformation about half the land was exempt from the system of inheritance. In 1600 some Faroese b\u00fdlingar and a few small villages, about 30 in number, were still a single estate, while almost all otherb\u00fdlingar had been divided up.\r\nIt is decisive for an archueological evalution of a Norse medieval estate whether the land belongs to the Church, the King or other institution, or whether it is alloidal land. In the former situation the estate can be one farm with one household, while in the latter it will usually have already been divided up into several farms and households in the medieval period. b\u00fdlingur sing, b\u00fdlingar pl; 'small group of houses forming a separate subdivision of a village'.\r\n&amp;nbsp;",

The school children were grouped according to extraction of permanent teeth and orthodontic treatment.\r\nThe studied group included only those who had received neither of these treatments (120 girls and 138 boys). Tables 1\u20148.The registrations were made according to the method of Bj\u00f8rk, Krebs &amp;amp; Solow (1963) for \u00bbEpidemiological Registration of Malocclusion\u00ab. After the examination, the data were checked for logically incompatible recordings.\r\nThe frequencies of the different traits of malocclusion were determined by means of computer programs developed by Solow &amp;amp; Helm (Solow 1964, Solow &amp;amp; Helm 1968), although rewritten to a BASIC version for this study. The pre-school children had few dentional anomalies, but high frequencies of occlusal and space anomalies. Every third child had extreme maxillary overjet, frontal open bite and distal molar occlusion, while 12 \u00b0/o had cross-bite, 36 % had spacing in the upper jaw and 33 \u00b0/o spacingin the lower jaw. Only 2 pre-school children had crowding (tables 13, 16 and 19).\r\nThe school children had higher frequencies of dentional anomalies, deep bite, scissors bite and crowding, equal frequencies of distal molar occlusion and cross-bite, and lower frequencies of extreme maxillary overjet, frontal open bite and spacing than the pre-school children (tables 14, 15, 17, 18, 20 and 21).\r\nCompared to the Danish pre-school children, the Faroese pre-school children had higher frequencies of frontal open bite, more mesial molar occlusion, less distal molar occlusion, fewer rotations and less spacing. The Faroese school children had higher frequencies of ectopic eruption,&amp;nbsp;inversion of incisors, distal molar occlusion and spacing, and lower frequencies of rotations and midline displacement than the Danish school children (tables 22\u201425). All differences mentioned were statistically significant.\r\nThe investigation included questionnaires which were answered by the school-children and by the parents of the pre-school children.

    "abstract": "This article considers a cross from Kirkjub\u00f8ur which came to the National Museum in Copenhagen in 1876, collection number D 11502. The author is grateful for this early opportunity to provide a fuller description of the cross. A description to have appeared in the list (p 85) in Fr\u00f3\u00f0skaparrit 24 (and mentioned in the table, p 88, and summary, p 108, ibidem) was misplaced in printing. It is sculpted from oak but covered with thin, handsomely ornamented copper plates (fig. 1).&amp;nbsp;\r\nOlder sources describe the cross as brass-plated. From this, one can speculate that it was originally gilded and that the traces of gilding could still be seen two hundred years ago. The overall height is 47.0 cm, the span of the transverse 40.4 cm andthe thickness of the elements 2.2 cm. Front, back and sides are all coppcrclad. The uppermost end of the upright and the ends of the transverse are carved with what appears to be a shamrock design. However, the uppermost leaf of the shamrock is not rounded as are the other two, but tongue-shaped. In the centre of each shamrock there is a socket surrounded by a raised edge. It is likely that an ornamental stone or possibly a gem stone was set in each socket. The copper sheathing on theback is intact (fig. 1), but the sheathing on the front is so peeled that the sockets on the arms have disappeared, leaving only the uppermost socket and a large socket at the junction of the upright and the transverse.\r\nThe upright has a wooden tang at the bottom, suggesting that the cross either stood on an altar or on a carrying pole. It can have stood on an altar and also have been carried during processions as it is ornamented on both front and back. A dating of 1400, with some latitude, is suggested. It is concluded that the cross may be the only Faroese processional cross that has been preserved.",

    "abstract": "Sources on Sheep-Milking in the Faroes. In modern historical treatises one frequently encounters the postulate that it has been the practice to milk sheep in the Faroes in the past. However, on reference to the source material it becomes clear that sheep-milking has definitely not been practised since circa 1600. Furthermore, on examination of the Sey\u00f0abrnevi\u00f0 of 1298, a special enactment for the Faroes mainly concerning sheep-breeding, it emerges that the structure of sheep-breeding in the 13th century was appreciably the same as deschribed in later times, and in that structure there was no place for sheep-milking(i. e. because of the poor domesticity of the sheep). The postulate, first stated by J. C. Svabo in 1782, was based on vague,unrecorded traditions and undocumented explanations of the place-name element kv\u00ed(ggj).\r\nIf sheep-milking has ever been practised in the Faroes, and that possibility during the earliest phases of settlement cannot be here dismissed, it will only be documented by arch\u00e6ological means and through a survey of the structures comparable to other structures which are definitely known to have existed in sheep-milking contexts in other countries. This must be the next avenue of investigation towards a final solution to this problem.",

The introduction traces the collection of names of fishing grounds from the time of Svabo to the present day and the author's own extensive collection covering all the islands. In the main body of the article, Parts /\u2014///, the author suggests some general categories of names based on his own collection. In the first part he deals with those fishing ground names in which the main element iseither a word which denotes a fishing ground (miS n., plinkurlplinki m., str\u00e1t n., pass n., repp n., lei\u00f0 f. etc.) or refers, in some way, to the topography of the fishing ground. In the second part he deals with fishing grounds which have acquired their names either from their shore bearings or from a place nearby on shore. In the third part, names of fishing grounds are dealt with which have no toponymic element either referring to a fishing ground or to the shore which can be seen from the fishingground. Often, it is difficult to interpret these names since we know the background of so few. However, when we do know the stories of their origins, we obtain a picture of the life of the inshore fisherman at sea and on shore, both in jest and in seriousness.",

    "abstract": "When considering variations of the surface temperature of the sea it is common practise to concentrate on the mean values over a certain period. It is argued that for some purposes the extreme values may be as relevant. The hydrographic conditions in Faroese waters are dominated by the presence of the Polar front (fig 1\u20142). A unique series of daily surface temperature observations exist from Mykines. The long-term variations have been given by Smed (Smed Ann. Biol., fig 3) based on mean monthly values.\r\nIn this paper we have looked for deviations from the mean on a shorter time scale i. e. by days. A visual inspection of the data (fig. 4) indicates that the deviations are not symmetrical but rather more negative. An analysis confirms this hypothesis. The data were high pass filtered and the number of deviations of various temperature intervals were counted. A distinction was made between positive and negative deviations. Table 1 and fig. 6 demonstrate the result. The temperature variations atMykines, thus are interpreted as composed of three parts: 1 A yearly variation, 2 \u00bbNoise\u00ab symmetrical with respect to the running mean, 3 Negative anomalies. It is the latter which has been studied in more detail. Figs. 7 and 8 demonstrate the distribution of anomalies ( &amp;gt; V \u00cd \u00b0 C) through the years (1920\u20141940) and in various months. The anomalies are significantly more frequent during wintertime.\r\nAs for the origin af the anomalies, it is argued that these are probably of an advective character indicating the presence of cold \u00bbblobs\u00ab or \u00bbeddies\u00ab in the waters of the Faroe shelf. Further evidence for this is presented in fig. 10 and evidence that temperature variations in these waters include advective processes as a dominant part is found also from a series of temperature \u25a0\u2014 current observations from SuSuroyarfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur (figs. 11, 12, 13, 14). The temperature variations observed were plotted against the Lagrangian coordinate x(t) of a fictitious water particle\r\ntx(t)=2v(i)-/\\tKv(i) being the observed current along the main axis at the time i and A t , the sampling interval. The fact that in these plots the curves are very often retraced when the current turns \u2014 as exemplified by fig. 15 \u25a0\u2014 indicates the importance of advective processes. As to the origin of the eddies, we assume their creation to be related to the Polar front which indeed does produce such entities (B. Hansen &amp;amp; J. Meincke, to be published). In conclusion we note the importance of such processes both from ahydrographical and biological point of view.",

    "abstract": "The dominant stanzaic forms of the Faroese popular songs in oral tradition are the ballad couplet and especially the ballad quatraine. The latter is thus the normal stanzaic meter of the Faroese heroic ballad which also shows a strong affinity regarding its style and its subject matter with Medieval \u00edcelandic literature, i. e. Eddic lays and sagas. In Iceland the heroic ballad is, however, only sparsely represented. Here the r\u00edmur poetry which has developed other stanzaic forms combining end rhyme and metrical alliteration, has had a dominating position dating back to late Medieval time. Compared to the heroic ballad the&amp;nbsp;r\u00edmur poetry shows much stronger ties regarding its form and content with such Medieval Icelandic literature as scaldic lays and sagas. Outside Iceland traces of Icelandic r\u00edmur poetry have only been found in the Faroe Islands where such a poem CCF 111 Koralds kv\u00e6\u00f0i was first recorded as early as 1639. The aim of my paper is to demonstrate that another Faroese popular \u00bbheroic ballad\u00ab, i. e. CCF 112 Bevusar tattir, originally represents an else lost Icelandic set of r\u00edmur (r\u00edmnajlokkur) which is supposed to have entered Faroese tradition either through oral og MS transmission before the end of 16th century.",

    "abstract": "As medieval sources on ecclesiastical conditions in the Faroe Islands are decidedly scanty, an attempt has hcre been made, partly by a survey of the post-Reformation accounts of Friis11 and Debes&quot; and of inventories taken in 1709 and 1729, and partly by investigation of the surviving objects, particularly those in the National Museum of Copenhagen and the Faroe Museum (F\u00f8roya Fornminnissavn), to identify articles and ornaments which may be presumed to be of the medieval period and thosewhich can so be dated with certainty. The material is listed in topographical order, with brief accounts of the type and place of origin of the objects, pag. 83 f and tables are given of the artifacts that can be dated pag. 88 f. The classes of object dealt with in this article are as follows, with their number given in brackets: crosier (1); episcopal chair (1); reliquaries, graves of saints (4); chalice (1); bells, the majority presumably mass&amp;nbsp;bells (19); crucifixes (10); processional cross (1); illumination implemcnts, candlesticks (8); madonnas (4); censer (1); soapstone baptismal fonts (9); wooden images (8); pew-ends (21); holy water fonts (3). Certain bronze objects from archeological investigations have not yet been studied in detail, and thus only their places of discovery are given. However, a short account is given of the circumstances of the discovery of objects from the old votive church in V\u00e1gur5, Su\u00f0uroy, dismantled in 1940\u201441, where under the floor was found: a silver chalice (Fig. 1); 3 pew-ends (Fig. 2); a tuff candlestick (Fig. 4); and a presumed holy water font fashioned from a shore-washed boulder (Fig. 4). In addition, an account is given of the hitherto uncompleted investigation of the medieval chapel on Mykines (Fig. 5), where among the objects found are a basalt candlestick (Fig. 6 and 7) and a bronze candle snuffer (vide: 33 \u2014 Fms: 4000/2). After the Reformation, a number of churches, especially small churches and chapels, were dismantled, the total then becoming 39. This investigation shows that in 29 of these there had certainly been medieval material, and that, in addition, there have been medieval artifacts recovered from 5 chapels or chapel ruins. This accounts for 34 of the medieval churches. However, evidence of the foundations of buildings traditionally identified as chapels suggests that there were several more in this period.",

At 400 to 700 meters depth these rock types only constitute 54 percent of the erratics, the rest being mainly sandstones and gneisses of distant origin. This sudden increase in the proportion of foreign erratics is probably caused by the front of the Faeroese ice sheet preventing ice-rafting over the shelf during the last glacial epoch.",

    "abstract": "Three things seem to indicate that Frisians have lived in the Faroe Islands in the past.\r\n1. The Legends about the Frisians. In Indberetninger 6 J. C. Svabo (1746 \u20141824) reports that settlement traces which are said to stem from Frisian colonists are to be found east of Sunnb\u00f8ur. In cwo letters (Landsb\u00f3kasavni\u00f0, T\u00f3rshavn) J. H. Schr\u00f8ter (1771\u20141851) writes that the Frisians have resided in the Faroe Islands at the same time as Irish hermits, that is to say, before the Norwegians came to the islands in 825. J. G. Forchhammer's Dagbok (1821) has a legend according to which the first settlers on Su\u00f0uroy were Frisian pirates at Akrabyrgi. In Antiquarisk Tidsskrift 1849\u20141851 it is said (by Schr\u00f8ter) that theseFrisians came to the Faroe Islands a long time after the Norwegian landnam, and (by V. U. Hammershaimb) that after the plague (1349\u20141350) the farmer at Akrabyrgi led the southern Faroemen against the bishop of Kirkjub\u00f8ur, who demanded too much money for a new church. A. W. Br\u00f8gger, in L\u00f8gtingss\u00f8ga F\u00f8roya, 1. b\u00f3k (1937), supposes that the name Frisian came in after the Norwegian invasion. Does this mean that Frisians came to the Faroe Islands on several occasions? In Seggjas\u00f8gur \u00far Sumba I (1963) P. F. Joensens thinks of the northern Frisians as being driven away by the Danish King Abel (t 1252). Heidentifies the farmer at Akrabyrgi as Hergeir, the adversary of Bishop Erlendur (t 1308). Thus we have a chronological difference in relation to the statement by Hammershaimb.\r\n2. Frislanda. The Frisian chroniclers Suffridus Petri and Martinus Hamconius (17th century) place the island of Frislanda north of Britannia in the period following the Germanic invasion. The name Frisland(a) and variants appear on maps from the 14th century (by Ranulfus de Hyggeden, Alberto Cantino, Martin Waldseemiiller, Petrus de Nobilibus Formis, Andrea Bianco, Juan de la Cosa). In 1558 a book by Nicol\u00f3 Zeno Jr.: De i commentarii I . . . . / della scoprimento dell' Isole Frislanda, was published in Venice. According to this book the Venetians Nicolo Sr. and Antonio have visited Frislanda in the 14th century. Zichmni, the adversary of the Norwegian king on the island, sailed together with Antonio to the west in the wake of the Frislanda fishermenwho reached even more distant coasts, which must refer to the American continent. A map, which is said to go back to an original from the 14th century, is added to the book. In The Annals of I . . . . I the brothers /..../ Zeno (1898) F. W. Lucas asserts that all this is pure fabrication. He had not read an article by E. Beauvois in Le Museon 1890 which connects the name of the island with the Legends about the Frisians. The name Frislanda for (part of) the Faroe Islands disappeared in time in favour of the present name. Thuse arose the theory of the drowned island of Frislanda.\r\n3. Fr\u00edsa v\u00edsa. There is a game to which a ballad was sung about Frisian pirates who kidnapped a girl. She is not set free until her bethrothed has paid the ransom. The Faroese variants were written down only at the beginning of the 19th century, the Icelandic ones at the beginning of the 18th century. Both groups mention the Frisian nationality of the pirates. In all other European variants, treated by Erich Pohl in Die deutsche Volksballade von der \u00bbLosgekauften\u00ab (1934), this feature is missing. Probably the original Danish model for the Faroese and Icelandic variants had this name, because in 1370 young girls were kidnapped by pirates in the Frisian Westerhever, which belonged to Denmark at that time. The oldest Icelandic variants place the event in Denmark, because they call the girl a 'Danamasr'. Instead of the route Denmark\u2014the Faroe Islands\u2014Iceland (Pohl), the ballad might as well have followed the route Denmark\u2014Iceland\u2014the Faroe Islands, or two routes independent of each other: Denmark\u2014Iceland and Denmark\u2014 the Faroe Islands. Fr\u00edsav\u00edsa in itself does not necessarily refer to Frisian settlement in the Faroe Islands, but it becomes interesting in connection with the above points 1 and 2.",

    "abstract": "The object of the present study was to find the incidence of LCPD and capital dysplasia in the population of The Faroe Islands, the incidence of familial cases cf the disease, and finally to describe the characteristical radiological changes of the disease in the various age groups.\r\nIt is seen that 50 % of the patients were younger than 5 years when the disease was diagnosed. Cases of capital dysplasia were dominant in the youngest age groupe, 7 of the 9 patients with capital dysplasia being less than 3 years old, while only one patient with LCPD and one patient in an intermediate state were less than 3 years old at the time of diagnosis. Cases of typical LPCD were dominant in patients aged between 5 and 9 years, some intermediate cases being found in the youngest, while patients who were more than 6 years old had exclusively LCPD, with the most severe cases in the oldest.\r\nFinally only 2 patients were more than 9 years old at the time of diagnosis, and osteochondritis dissecans was diagnosed in both cases. It seems to appear from the radiological changes that growth disorders may be dominant in the youngest patients, while the typical aseptic necroses are dominant in the age group between 5 and 9 years, in accordance with the nature of the blood supply to the capital epiphysis in this age group as described by Trueta (1957) and others.&amp;nbsp;\r\nIt was found that bilateral cases were more frequent in patients with dysplasia than in patients with LCPD. Bone age was most frequently delayed in patients with capital dysplasia. The incidence of LCPD was found to be more than twice as high in theFaroe Islands compared with Denmark, and the familial cases were far more frequent than found in other series. Osteochondroses with other sites were also found in the families. These findings point to the possibility of capital dysplasia as being expressive of a hereditary primary growth disturbance, with delayed and irregular growth of epiphysis of the femoral head, which, in its turn, may be a disposing factor in the development of LCPD.",

The incidence now is at the same level as in Norway about 15 years ago and in Denmark about 30 years ago (table 8). A possible explanation for this delay is that smoking of cigarettes become usual in the Faroes 20\u201430 years later than in neighbour countries.",

    "abstract": "A survey has been carried out of homicides committed in the Faroes, from the time of the first occupation of the islands until the present day. F\u00f8royingas\u00f8ga and the Faroese records are the primary sources. Research has shown that the majority of homicides about which any information can be traced were committed in the time covered by the saga and in the seventeenth century (see Table I). Table II shows that several of the offenders, and of the victims, were foreigners. The frequency with which various methods of killing appear in the sources is given. The motives of homicides are to be found in Table III, which shows that the most usual motive was self-defence. The places of homicides are given in Table IV, where it will be seen that the island where most homicides occurred was Su\u00f0uroy. The reason for this is that well over half the homicides committedin Su\u00f0uroy happened with the plundering of the island by pirates in the seventeenth century. There is some dispute as to whether the sources may be relied on. Instances quoted show that certain records are not reliable, since either too many homicides, or too few, are mentioned in them.",

Furthermore there are marane diatoms (Paralia), pollen of Empetrumand Gramineae in great number, some pollen grains of birch and a&amp;nbsp;few pollen grains of pine and hazel. The wood has been radiocarbon dated to &amp;gt; 30.000 years. The upper till shows a retreat and later advance of the ice front.

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the demographic development on the Faroe Islands. Using the socalled comparative and flow diagrams developped by Kurt Witthauer, the crude birth rates and crude death rates are shown in fig. I for the Faroes and some neighbour countries around 1780, making visible the very special situation for the Faroes in this period. Both the crudebirth rate and the death rate are much lower than in the other countries. The flow diagram, fig. 2, with birth rate as ordinate and death rate as abscissa, shows the evolution in the rates for the period 1770\u20141780 to 1961\u201465, with the single years 1969 and 1970 to give an impression of the trend today when \u00bbthe pill\u00ab is more commonly used. The natural increase in population can be read on the oblique lines. As shown on the&amp;nbsp;figure it is estimated that the fertility rate will fall with Ve from 23 \u00b0/ooto 19 or 18 \u00b0/oo, and the death rate will increase slowly to about 8 \u00b0/oo, due to the aging of the population. These trends together are estimated to give a natural increase of about 10 \u00b0/oo, shown on the figure with a dotted area in the lower, right side of the diagram. On fig. 4 the migrations are taken in consideration. Abscissa = net migrations which can be positive or nagative. Ordinate = natural increase. Oblique lines = actual increase. The migrations are calculated indirectly, using the known figures for the total population in different years (the censuses) and the registrated numbers of births and deaths. Usually there is a net migration out from the Faroes. Only two periods in the 19 th century are showing net immigration. As the peak is reached in the crude birth rate, the net emigration is simultaneously increasing. Following the economic crisis in thefirst half of the 1950-ie5, there is a very serious emigration, but later the figures stabilizes on about 4 \u00b0/oo. With the supposed lowering in natural increase, the actual increase in the Faroese population is estimated to be only 8 \u00b0/o or maybe lower in the nearest future, (the dotted area). The composistion of the net migration of the net migration stream to Denmark (figures for the total net migration are not available, but 80\u201485 \u00b0/o of the faroese migrations are going to Denmark) are calculated as themean for the period 1961\u201468, fig. 3. The figure makes the remarkable feature clear that 50 % of this stream is made up of women in the class 15\u201419 years, and there is a net emigration in all classes except for men in the class 25\u201429 years, which balances. This distorted composition of the net migration stream results in an ever increasing number of men per 100 women. In earlier periods there was a surplus of women. The proportion balanced in 1921 and 1925, but in 1966 there were 110 men per 100 women.\r\nThe outlook for the future growth of the faroese population is, according to these estimates for the near future, not very brigth. The main causes are the present lowering in the birth rate and the distortion of the composition of the population, caused by the serious surplus emigration of young women.",

The herring feed was composed of Acartia sp. besides some few Temora longicornis. Acartia longiremis and Acartia Clausii were dominating in the plankton samples, ohiefly females with egg sacks.",

The greater part of the patients had pain radiating to the thorax, most frequently to the left half of the thorax. The most important objective findings were pressure tenderness, hyperaesthesia, and scoliosis, and the most important radiographic findings were narrowing of the discs and formation of ostheophytes (see Eig. 1\u20148).

In 1828 he made a journey to Copenhagen, but besides he spent his life as a farm-hand at the small village of Skarvanes on Sandoy, however, almost exclusively engaged in hunting, trout fishing and painting. His possible qualifications and influences are discussed, the result being that he is likely to have been a self-taught man, and inaddition a solitary soul. He is the only Faroese representative from the rich epoch of bird-painting that flourished in Europe and America in the 18th century and the former half of the 19th century.&amp;nbsp;",

II a emprunt\u00e1 quelques-uns de ces noms \u00e1 des auteurs anterieurs, mais d'autres noms, avec les oiseaux euxmemes, ont \u00e1t\u00e1 envoyes des Feroe en France par le capitaine Francois Thurot, qui visita les lles dans l'hiver de 1759/60 (A. Degn 1927).&amp;nbsp;Quelques-uns de ces noms ne se trouvent pas dans des sources \u00e1crites anterieures \u00e1 Brisson.\r\nSuivent des remarques etymologiques sur quelques-uns de ces mots. Le francais alque n'a pas ete emprunte au norvegien (FEW XV. 1, 17), mais au latin scientifique, qui l'a emprunte au feroien. \u2014 Comme nous l'avons montr\u00e1 dans des articles ant\u00e1rieurs (voir la bibliographie cidessus, il n'y a aucune raison de penser que le francais eider ait ete emprunte au suedois par le commerce (FEW XV. 2, 84), mais le mot a ete emprunt\u00e1 au latin scientifique, qui doit le tenir de l'islandais; il est vrai que le premier \u00e1 l'employer en latin, Ole Worm (1655), d\u00e1clare avoir reju l'oiseau des Fero\u00e1, mais la forme eider ne peut etre qu'islandaise (et l'islandais n'est pas la langue des Fero\u00e1, cf. R. Arveiller 1963, 103\u20144). \u2014 Le mot gorfou a ete cree par Brisson, non d'apres un mot danois&amp;nbsp;(Robert III 301; Nouv. dict. etym. Larousse; le danois n'est pas la langue des F\u00e1ro\u00e1), mais d'apres le nom feroi'en Goirfugel, comme l'ecrivait Clusius en 1605, aujourd'hui gorfuglur.\r\nUn nomen agentis germanique, *harilon, plus tard *herla 'oiseau qui fait du bruit', derive de *hari)\u00f3n 'piller, devaster', peut etre l'etymon de plusieurs mots dont l'etymologie a ete inconnue jusqu'ici: la seconde partie du fero\u00eden \u00f3gvella 'harelde' et de l'isl. h\u00e1vella, haferla (ecrit Havellda par Worm 1655, change fautivement par des auteurs posterieurs en Harelda, forme employee en latin scientifique, d'o\u00fa harelde en fran^ais, voir Lockwood 1961, p. 11), l'ecossais herle 'h\u00e1ron', l'anglais *Herle(-king) (d'o\u00fa le francais Hellequin, Harlequin), et l'anglais *herle (d'o\u00fa le francais herle, harle, nom d'oiseau); de mSme l'etymon du francais gievre 'grebe; harle' (FEW XII 244), de l'occitan gahre, nom de plusieurs oiseaux (FEW IV 17) et du francoprov. grebe (FEW XXI 246) est probablement la racine celtique et germanique *grbo- 'oiseau qui fait du bruit' (Marstrander 1910, 391), plut\u00f3t que le celtique *gabro- 'bouc'. Un nomen actionis francique apparente, *harila(n) 'tumulte, bruit', peut avoir passe dans le franfais deux fois: avant l'umlaut: harele 'tumulte, bruit', et de nouveau apres l'umlaut et la syncope: herle 'bruit', d'o\u00fa herler 'faire du bruit'; pour d'autres explications, voir FEW XVI 149 et M.

They were not aware of the fact that in late medieval time in Norway h\u00fastr\u00fa was title of the wife of an esquire (v\u00e1pnari) or a man of a simular rank. Mr. Jacob Jacobsen was the first one to point out this special meaning&amp;nbsp;in connection with the Faroese tradition, but as he knew only the forms of Hammershaimb he writes h\u00fastr\u00fa and h\u00fasfr\u00fa(gv) at random.\r\nBut the broadcast lecture of Mr. Hanus Samuelsen, himself a native of H\u00fasav\u00edk, made it clear that the original form has been h\u00fastr\u00fain. There is no evidence that h\u00fastr\u00fa Elin Eiriksd\u00f3ttir, who lived in the first half of the 15th century, had other connection with the Faroes than hereditary land. But a letter of 1.

In addition examples are given of popular belief concerning the Friday, showing two opposite conceptions: According to one a child born on a Friday will be safe from withcraft, and the other, which is more widespread, claims that Friday is an unluky day to embark upon a new enterprise, to put on a new garment the first time, to stand out to sea first time in the year and the like.",

    "abstract": "The article is about keeping swine in the Faroes in old times. In his book about the place-names in the Nor\u00f0uroyar Chr. Matras tells us, that the place-names show that hogs have been kept here from the oldest time up to the reformation. This is confirmed by the finding of bones of swine from old times at several places, and in the litterature swinekeeping is mentioned by Peder Clausen Friis (1592) and Jens Lauridsen Wolf (1651).\r\nThe about 50 place-names with relation to keeping of swine, which are mentioned in the article, are tetling us, that hogs have been kept both in the infield (often near the houses) and in the outfield (sometimes far away).\r\nAccording to the legend of Snopprikkur from the 16th century food was carried out to the pigs in the outfield. It is also told here that in addition to remains from the housekeeping the hogs were fed with malt. The import of malt is mentioned in the Faroese court-book 1615\u201454, but only in little quantities, so it must have been impossible to feed many hogs with malt only. Clausen Friis tells that the pigs were fed with \u00bbtormentilla\u00ab (Potentila erecta). The Faroese name of this plant being bark it is probable that the author has meant sv\u00ednabark (Ranunculus sp.). Besides plants hogs are eating slugs, insects and worms, and in someother countries they often were fed with fish. Robert Cowie tells that so was with the Shetland hogs.&amp;nbsp;At that time \u2014 about 1870 \u2014 there were ca. 5.000 hogs in Shetland.\r\nFormerly the number was lesser owing to the damage tihat the hogs were making by rooting the ground, which is mentioned several times in the Shetland court-book 1602\u201404. It is possible that this damage made by pigs has caused the cessation of the swine-keeping in the Faroes. In the report from the Royal Commission of 1709\u201410 it is mentiones that hogs were not kept on account of their spoiling of the fields and meadows. Later on \u2014 in the 19th and 20th century \u2014 it has been tried to revive the keeping of swine in the Faroes, but there have never been many. During the last war the Britisih forces kept a good deal of hogs here, but to day there are no pigs in the Faroes.",

    "abstract": "It is a well-known characteristic feature of most central Scandinavian dialects that the phonemic sequences /rs/, /rt/, /rd/, and /rn/ are realized a s [?]&amp;gt; [t]&amp;gt; [&amp;lt;!]&amp;gt; a n f i [&quot;.]&amp;gt; i-e- a s single retroflex phones as the result of total assimilation. In the present paper attention is drawn to the same type of assimilation in Faroese.\r\nThe phonemes /t/, /d/, and /n/ in Faroese are usually described as dentals. With the exception of [g] (Lockwood, Risohel), the retroflex variants of the dental phonemes have not been observed by research scholars. The present author has transcribed some 5000 words from tape recordings of unrehearsed connected speech, representing three informants. All sequences of /r/ plus /s/, /t/, /d/, or /n/ in the transcriptions have been registered and analysed.\r\nThe former part of the article deals with some discrepancies between the orthographic and phonemic systems of Faroese. Cases where &amp;lt;(r) appears in the orthography but has no phonemic equivalent are discarded, before the influence o( /r/ on adjacent consonants is discussed.\r\nIn the latter part of the article the result of the investigation is presented. The sequence /r/ plus /s/, /t/, /d/, or /n/ may be realized in three ways: 1) [r] plus dental allophone, 2) [r] plus retroflex allophone, 3) retroflex allophone alone. Thus the single retroflex phones [g], [(,] etc. are interpreted as realizations of the phonemic sequences /rs/, /rt/ etc.\r\nThe phonemic sequences in question are pronounced as follows. (4.1) /rs/ in a word is always realized as one phone, [ s ] , which is long after a stressed vowel \u2014 as in f\u00fdrs \u00bbeighty\u00ab \u2014 and short after an unstressed vowel \u2014 as in forstandi \u00bb(I) understand\u00ab \u2014. (4.2, 4.3) /rt/ and /rd/ are realized as two phones after a stressed vowel, the phonemic length of the cluster being realized in [r:]. The stop is generally retroflex, seldom dental. Examples: burtur \u00bbaway\u00ab, st\u00f3rt \u00bbbig\u00ab, Ixrdu (pret. pl. of lara) \u00bbtaught\u00ab, hoyrdi (pret. sg. of hoyra) \u00bbheard\u00ab. After an unstressed vowel the sequence /rt/ is pronounced [rt ] or [t]&amp;gt; t r i e sequence /rd/ nearly always [ 4 ] - (4.4) The phonetic realization of /rn/ in a word is [rn] or [rn,], the latter variant being more frequent. The phonemic sequence /rn/ is by no means so frequent as the graphemic equivalent &amp;lt;(rn), for two reasons: 1) The plural endings -ir, -ar, -ur cast out the /r/ when the definite article (-nir, -nar) is added, 2) ^ r n ) is the graphemic rendering of /dn/ in most words where &amp;lt;(rn^&amp;gt; is included in one morpheme, e.g. barn \u00bbchild\u00ab. (5) As a rule assimilation (partial or total) also takes place, when one word ends with /r/ and the following begins with a dental phoneme. Example: for n\u00f3%v \u00bbtoo much\u00ab.\r\nAt last it is also pointed out that every dental phoneme following immediately after a retroflex consonant adopts the same place of articulation, thus becoming retroflex itself. Example: skarst (pret. passive of skera) [skag:);] \u00bbwas cut\u00ab. The investigation shows that the retroflex allophones of dental consonant phonemes are the rule after /r/ in unrehearsed Faroese speech. These allophones are frequent and they are clearly distinguished from the corresponding dental allophones boch acoustically and articulatorically. It is the author's opinion that the set of retroflex consonants described above should ,be included in detailed descriptions of Faroese pronunciation.",

    "abstract": "Previously it was believed that J\u00f3n Arason (died 1550) was the last Icelandic poet to observe the old rules of quantity, but Stef\u00e1n Karlsson has pointed out that as late as 1643 poetry was being written in the old manner.\r\nThe difference in length between \u00ed and i, for example, was secondary, the main difference being that \u00ed was tense, whereas i was lax. The first stage in this development was that + tense: -r tense lost its significance, and + length: -j- length became the deciding factor both for the old lax vowels and all diphthongs. In modern Icelandic there is no phonetic difference between long and short vowels, whereas such a difference does exist in modern Faroese.\r\nIn Icelandic diplomas from ca. 1300\u20141450 there are many examples of doubled intervocalic consonants, mostly following a lax vowel (for example sammann), and following diphthongs, most often ei (nteitta\u00f0i); the same phenomenon is present in Norwegian diplomas from the same time, although in the Icelandic // appears only sproradically for / (Steff\u00e1n), whereas the Norwegian has many examples of this. In the oldest of these diplomas there are also many examples of uncertainty as to whether the tensity of a vowel should be indicated by doubling it or by adding a diacritical mark over it, and in the case of the length of a consonant, whether to double it: m\u00e1\u00e1lum, naat, setu, snori, aara instead of m\u00e1lum, n\u00e1tt, settu, Snorri, Ara. Examples of this uncertainty also occur in modern Icelandic (orusta : orrusta). Diphthongization of e began already in the 13th century, that of &amp;lt;* around 1400, whereas diphthongization of \u00e1 and \u00f3 \\s not observed in writing before the 15th and 16th centuries. At the same time, or perhaps somewhat later, lax vowels became long before short consonants. The unstressed vowels i and u were first written e and o, since they corresponded to e and 6. When e became a diphthong, i was written when unstressed, and by analogy, u. Somewhat different was the development of foreign loanwords: \u00c1dam and (.va. Delabialization of y and \u00fd is more recent, beginning around or after 1500, but examples of a difference between y and i are still to be found in the ballad book of Gissur Sveinsson (born 1604). Delabialization of y in the diphthong ey, however, began already in the first half of the 14th century. The corresponding development in the other Scandinavian languages is also mentioned.",

    "abstract": "In the so-called Fourth Grammatical Treatise which is preserved in a 14th century manuscript (AM 242 fol., Codex Wormianus) there are incorporated three stanzas (one of them incomplete) in scaldic metre (dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt). The aim of the poet was apparently to point out the interrelationship of certain similar words, and it is striking that all of them have the vowels \u00e1, \u00f3 or \u00e6 (umlaut of a), ce (umlaut of \u00f3) in the root syllable. The fact that the poet's interest was limited to words with these vowels indicates a connection between the stanzas and a phonetic ohange which took place in Icelandic in the 13th century: the rounded vowel oe was replaced by the unrounded \u00c6. The stanzas can be explained by assuming that the author was a conservative man who regretted that the previous distinction between the two umlaut vowels was disappearing. A more detailed interpretation presents several problems which are discussed in the paper. It seems almost certain that the stanzas were written down from oral tradition and that the text is incorrect at some points.",

The Icelandic word for 'Alaria esculenta', an edible seaweed, shows a number of different forms. The authenticity of one 18th century example of Myri-kiarni was discussed by Chr. Matras, and his conclusion is borne out by the occurrence of m\u00fdrikjarni in Northern Iceland, see Map 2. IV. According to Chr. Matras Icel. s\u00f3lvam\u00e6\u00f0ur 'a kind of seaweed' is in all probability a loan translation of Scottish Gaelic mathair an duilisg 'carrageen, Irish moss'. The sources do not agree as to the meaning of the word, but still it is quite possible that Chr. Matras' hypothesis is right. V. In Icelandic annals a skin-boat is mentioned in the year 1666 on Hv\u00edt\u00e1, a major salmon river. This river is comparable to e.g. the Severn, the Shannon or the Boyne, where the use of currachs persisted into the 20th century. But nothing further is known about skin-boats in Icelandand Celtic influence cannot be proved. But several well-documented instances of cultural traits borrowed by the Norse from the Celts have been discussed by Chr. Matras. Amongst these is the use of seaweed for food. But whereas Gaelic has contributed words for edible seaweed in the Faroes and in Iceland, a Norse loan word kvanneq occurs, according to Thalbitzer, as a word for a kind of edible seaweed in Labrador Eskimo, on the continent of Native America.&amp;nbsp;",

In Old-Norse, these stems are mainly characterized by the plural -r, in contrast to the vowel-stems and \u00bb-stems, whose plural is formed by either -ar, -ir or -ur, but in Faroese they have, by separating some words (3. a. and partly e.) and attracting others, developed to be a group mainly characterized by i-Vmlaut in the plural (to some degree veiled by \u00ab-Umlaut \u00ab&amp;gt;o). Each word is treaded in 3. It is pointed out (3. d.), that several of the words, when definite, have kept their plural -r, which is else assimilated to the -n- of the article \u2014 a fact which does not clearly show from normal Faroese orchography. Furthermore it is shown (3. e.), that in some cases a preserved old plural form has given rise to new plural forms, which may sometimes spread into the singular as well.",

    "abstract": "Those engaged in Scandinavian ballad research are in agreement that chey reckon with an East-Scandinavian and a West-Scandinavian region. Caracteristic of the West-Scandinavian region are the heroic and troll ballads. The situation in Iceland is unique, so that for the most part the West-Scandinavian region comprises the Faroe Islands and Norway. In this case, which was the center for the composition of heroic and troll ballads, the Faroe Islands or Norway? There are two opposing opinions&amp;nbsp;here, the one represented by Knut Liest\u00f8l, Sverker Ek, and H. Griiner-Nielsen. They maintained that Norway was the most important area, w\u00edth Bergen as the center of diffusion, and that a large number of the heroic and troll ballads spread from there to the Faroes. In opposition was the view of E. von der Reoke, that the West-Scandinavian ballads had their center in the Faroes.\r\nIn recent years new material has appeared, which seems to cast new Hght on the Faroese-Norwegian relationship. This is a systematic catalog of the ballad compositions in the Sohandinavian languages, prepared by Dr. Bengt Jonsson of the Svenskt Visarkiv and the author. Here the ballads are arranged in categories according to the traditional scheme: ballads concerning nature myths, ballads concerning legends, and so on. When it comes to the typical West-Scandinavian categories, the heroicand troll ballads, the catalog shows strong Faroese dominance. It is so unamhiguous and so convincing, that there is reason to maintain the applicability of E. von der Recke's theory that the Faroe Islands were the most important area within the West-Scandinavian region.",

    "abstract": "In the Arnamagnean Collection in Copenhagen there are two vellum leaves, AM 687b 4to, the remnants of a book of song (free organum for 2 and 3 voices). The manuscript is written by an Icelander. Its first known owner was Porleifur Bjornsson, minister at Reykh\u00f3lar (16th century). Fol. lv\u20142v contain scores, but on Fol. lr there are eight riddles, three verses and one Pula (fragment?), written in the 16th century. These rhymes are printed here in orthography of the manuscript, but riddles nr.1\u20147 have previously been printed (inexactly) from a copy by Hallgr\u00edmur Scheving (JS 289 8vo) in Islenzkar g\u00e1tur (Icelandic Riddles), collected by J\u00f3n \u00c1rnason, Copenhagen 1887, and riddle nr. 4 also in Almanak hins \u00edslenzka pj\u00f3\u00f0vinafelags 1876.It is clear from errors owing to misreadings that the writer of 687b has copied the riddles from a book, and from the beginnings of nr. 6: Hverr er s\u00e1 inn pri\u00f0i (Who is the third one), nr. 7: Hverr er s\u00e1 inn ellejti (Who is the eleventh one) and nr. 8: Mggr er s\u00e1 inn n\u00edti\u00e1ndi (The nineteenth is a son) it may be deduced that they come from a collection of riddles. The riddles are in the Ij\u00f3\u00f0ah\u00e1ttr metre but the lines are unusually long and all the stanzas are more than 6 lines (9, 12 and 15). They contain a few words that are either rare or otherwise unknown in Icelandic and a few with unusual meanings: 2.9 rauf, fem. \u00f3-stem, used tomean the same as Da. r\u00f8v, Sw. rov. \u2014 2.10 hjassi, masc. an-stem, meaning&amp;nbsp;the same as Da. isse, Sw. hj\u00e1sse; this is also found in r\u00edmur. \u2014 3.7 sau\u00f0afeitt, where feitt is obviously the same as Da. fat, Sw. Dial. fatt, Old Sw. ulla f\u00e6tter, ought to be &quot;'f\u00e6tt in Icelandic, here used to mean uncombed wool or a sheep's woolen coat. \u2014 4.6 knapaldr, neutr., unknown from other sources, here probably used for a block of wood. \u2014 6.2 pari (or parri), masc. an-stem, the same as Sw. tarre. \u2014 8.4 v\u00edgn\u00fdra, neutr., thesame word as Old Gotlandic 'vigniauri', i. e. testicle. The solution of the riddles is: No. 1: a steelyard. \u2014 No. 2: a mouldfor forging nails. \u2014 No. 3: wool combs. \u2014 No. 4: a footstool. \u2014 No. 5: a pot-hook. \u2014 No. 6: a bell clapper. \u2014 No. 7: a fish-hook, probably one with a bent stem. \u2014 No. 8: a stalk of angelica. Dating the riddles is problematic, but in all probability they are fromthe 12th or 13th century. They have probably been written down in the same place as the verses, which are of different ages, no. 9 probably oldest and no. 12 youngest. East Nordic words suggest that the riddles have not been composed in Iceland and che verses are obviously not Icelandic. The author does not feel competent to pronounce whether the riddles and the verses were composed in the eastern part of Norway, or perhaps in Sweden. In the above-mentioned work by J\u00f3n \u00c1rnason the riddles no. 1060, 535 and 777 are orally transmitted fragments derived from the riddles here numbered 3, 5 and 8.",

Hammershaimb's source edition 1851\u201455 called forth German collections translated by P. J. Willatzen 1865 (including the Sigurd Cycle and thoroughly revised 1897) and by Rosa Warrens 1866. Around 1900, Leon Pineau in France translated Faroese texts in a scholarly monograph (prose fragments only) and in a highly deserved anthology, while more recent times have seen one relevant book, one of E.

It is the authors opinion, that it is an early coincidence of fem. -(i)nni with neutr. -(i)nu, arisen through a weakening of the unstressed vowel -u for the benefit of -i, which is the presupposition of this particular development, in that fem. and neutre have formed a block with the ending -(i)ni, who has pushed into the masculine.\r\nIt is also brought into notice, that the original dative-form of weakly inflected adjectives in the plural, -um, which in Faroese usually is superseded by -u from the other cases, has been preserved in the dialect of Fugloy, the eastermost of the six Nor\u00f0uroyar.",

    "abstract": "This article challenges the traditional assumptions about one of the famous villains of Faroese history, Charles Baron Hompesch, who paid a visit to T\u00f3rshavn in his capacity as a privateer in the summer of 1808,&amp;nbsp;sailing under British letters of marque, and removed both the public money chests and the stores in the warehouses of the Royal Danish Monopoly. The Faroese view of Baron Hompesch has usually been that he was a cruel plunderer, indifferent to the suffering he caused, butintent only on enriching himself at the cost of a defenceless people. The author first shows that this opinion was held in England, too, in Hompesch's time; but he goes on to demonstrate that the view arises from an account of the affair by the Danish commandant of the T\u00f3rshavn fort, Emilius Lobner, which can be shown in part to be false and one-sided. The money and goods were eventually returned to the Faroe Islands, the Prize Court having refused to award them to Hompesch. Thejudgement did not, however, arise from any misconduct of Baron Hompesch in Faroe, but from a prior claim of the British Crown, based on the capitulation signed by L\u00f8bner when the Clio, a British naval brig, disarmed the T\u00f3rshavn fort two weeks before Hompesch's visit.",

Four of the patients had symptoms of pancreatic affection,, in one thediagnosis of chronic pancreatitis was confirmed by calcifications demonstrated on X-ray.

    "abstract": "The absorption from the stomach and small intestine of some drugs with different physico-chemical properties was studied in rats, under the influence of ethanol. This was administered either together with the drugs, or was present in the organism in a steady concentration during the time of absorption. Ethanol was found capable of significantly enhancing the drug absorption from the stomach. This, however, only applied to drugs, which are absorbed fairly well even without ethanol, because of their degree of ionization and lipoid solubility at the pH of the stomach. It was shown that this positive effect of ethanol was due toan enhanced blood supply to the gastric mucosa. When administered in concentrations higher than 10 %&amp;gt; (w/v), this positiv effect of ethanol was again abolished, because of its irritating effect on the gastric mucosa. By the method used, ethanol was shown to be without any influence on the absorption from the small intestine. This is considered to be due to the presence of near optimal conditions for absorption at this site. In this publication in contrast to an earlier one on the same subject (Magnussen 1968), the significance of the results in the practical life are discussed in details.",

    "abstract": "Faroese has normally preaspirated p, t, k after short vowel. The change between long vowels (i. e. diphthongs usually) and short vowels (i. e. monophthongs usually) is here determined by the weight of the subsequent consonants, whether, on one hand, these were short in Old Norse or, on the other hand, long or more than one. It is pointed out in the paper that in the dialect spoken on the island of Su\u00f0uroy, some consonant groups of which p, t, k form the first element, have no preaspiration in spite of a preceding short vowel. In Faroese such groups, as a rule, have to be preeeded by an irregularly long vowel. In other words, the Su\u00f0uroy dialect has always a short vowel before the consonant groups of the ancient language or a long consonant, but the development of preaspiration of consonant groups is conditional on the consonant with which the stops p, t, k are collocated.",

    "abstract": "Rats and mice are the only wild mammals to be found in the Faroe Islands. The latter are presumably brought to the country by the Irish hermits. Mice are not to be found on all the islands and the damage caused by them is not so extensive as to require special legislation.\r\nThe black rat has presumably come to the Faroe Islands in the Middle Ages, as an epidemic like the Black Death could hardly develop without the presence of rats. There is some indication that the rats \u2014 apart from T\u00f3rshavn \u2014 have disappeared from the islands after the Black Death, and that only towards the middle of the 17th century they have gained ground again.\r\nIt is supposed that the brown rat came to the Faroe Islands in 1768. Ii soon spread over most of the islands and crowded out the black rat. It caused serious damage at the beginning, but it looks as if the damage has been less in the 19th century. In 1895 and 1902 there are grannastevnur (meetings of the landowners of a village) which deal with matters concerning rat extermination. In 1907/08 the question of the coming into force of the Danish Rats and Mice Destruction Act of March 22, 1907, is submitted to the L\u00f8gting (the Faroese Parliament), the members of which take no interest in it. The subsequent Danish Ratsand Mice Destruction Act of April 18, 1910, is put into force by promulgation without having been submitted to the L\u00f8gting, but it becomes of no importance. On the other hand, in 1915/16 the L\u00f8gting deals with a matter concerning the rat nuisance but leaves extermination to private enterprise, and from 1916/17 there are a couple of regulations adopted at grannastevnur concerning rat extermination. The Danish Rats and Mice Destruction Act of March 29, 1924 is put into force in the Faroe Islands without submission to the L\u00f8gting, but as was the case with the Act of 1910, it acquires no importance. It has hardly beenrealized that it was in force in the country, which, among other things, appears from the discussion of the L\u00f8gting in 1937/38 on the organization of rat extermination in the Faroe Islands. In the last part of the paper the author goes through the L\u00f8gting&amp;nbsp;Act of June 1, 1961, governing rat extermination and the annexed circular of May 16, 1962.",

    "abstract": "This paper first refers to the occurrence of palatalized g and k in Old Norse, which sounds correspond to purely palatal sounds in Faroese. By showing presence and absence of velar sound in Old Norse and comparing with Faroese, it is evident that palatal pronunciation of g-k in Faroese does not always correspond to the palatalized pronunciation in Old Norse, which, ergo, applies to the velar pronunciation as well.",

    "abstract": "Dans les recueils manuscrits de ballades feroiennes se trouve un cycle de ballades dont le personnage central est Charlemagne. Quatre ballades font partie du cycle dans tous les recueils (\u00e1 une exception pres), et elles proviennent toutes de Karlamagni\u00eds saga (Kms) et/ou de la traduction danoise de celle-ci, Karl Magnus' Kr\u00f8nike (KMK). Ces ballades, que nous&amp;nbsp;appelons primaires, sont Odvaldsr\u00edma, Geipat\u00e1ttur, Emundsr\u00edma et Runsivalsstr\u00ed\u00f0, qui ont ete composees d'apres les branches de Kms et/ou de KMK qui traduisent la Chanson d'Otinel, le Pelerinage ou Voyage de Charlemagne, la Chanson d'Aspremont et !a Chanson de Roland, respectivement.\r\nLes deux dernieres forment une unite, que les manuscrits divisent de facons differentes, et qui est vraisemblablement le premier noyau du cycle, auquel les deux premieres sont venues s'ajouter. On y a ajoute depuis deux autres ballades, Aligast et Fl\u00f3vinsr\u00edma, qui n'ont pas les memes origines que les quatre ballades primaires, mais qui font partie du cycle dans quelques-uns des manuscrits. Charlemagne figure dans d'autres ballades aussi, qui ne font pas partie du cycle.\r\nApres un apercu des ballades secondaires, les quatre ballades primaires sont examinees plus en detail. Aucune d'elles n'est trouvee hors des Feroe: ce n'est que par les sources communes qu'elles sont apparentees aux r\u00edmur islandaises et aux ballades des autres pays scandinaves traitant des memes sujets. Cela n'exclut pas la possibilite que les ballades fero'iennes auraientete composees en Norvege pour y etre perdues et ne survivre qu'aux Feroe, mais d'autre part rien ne vient \u00e1 l'appui de cette hypothese. La version utilisee de Kms est la version beta, ecrite en Islande \u00bbafter 1320, possibly well after\u00ab (Peter G. Foote). La version utilisee de KMK est sans doute celle de Christiern Pedersen, dont la premiere edition parut en 1534. Les ballades sont donc en tout cas posterieures au milieu du XlVe siecle, et elles ne sont guere posterieures au XVIIe siecle, parce qu'apres cette date on n'a guere eu de manuscrit de Kms.\r\n11 est tres difficile de choisir entre les trois possibilites suivantes: 1) Les ballades ont ete composees d'apres Kms seulement, et tous les elements provenant de KMK ont ete introduits au cours des siecles. Elles peuvent etre anterieures \u00e1 1534, mais elles peuvent aussi etre posterieures \u00e1 cette date. 2) Les ballades ont ete composees d'apres Kms et KMK (ce qui n'exclutpas que quelques elements provenant de KMK aient ete introduits plus tard). Elles sont posterieures \u00e1 1534. 3) Les ballades ont ete composees d'apres KMK seulement, et les elements provenant de Kms ont ete introduits plus tard. Elles sont poster\u00edeuresa 1534. De ces trois possibilites, la derniere est la moins probable et la premiere la plus probable. Un examen linguistique des ballades, qui reste \u00e1 faire, pourrait jeter plus de lumiere sur le probleme de i'\u00e1ge et de la patrie des ballades.",

    "abstract": "After the July revolution in France in 1830 the Danish government decided to establish the assembly of the Estates of the Realm for the various provinces. The Faroe Islands were not mentioned in the bill in 1831. Professor Schlegel, who was a member of the committee \u00bbDe oplyste M\u00e6nd\u00ab, requested the King in a private petition dated 18th August 1832 to let the assembly system include the Faroe Islands. In the suggestion to the meeting of the Ministers of State, dated 8th November 1833, the officialsadvised against giving the Faroe Islands a special representation in the assembly of the Estates of the Realm because they were only such a small province without direct communication with Denmark However, the result of the meeting of the Ministers of State was that the King resolved that the Faroe Islands should be represented in the assembly of the Estates of the Realm for the Danish Islands and Iceland. The resulution, which was made on rather a random basis, made the Faroe Islands subject to the Danish political representative system. This resolution is still in force.",

    "abstract": "Two cases of puerperal inversio uteri are reported. The literature has been briefly reviewed and the aetiology as well as the frequency of inversio uteri has been discussed. In most cases the inversion is spontaneous, but a usual cause of inversio uteri is supposed to be too heavy expression of the afterbirth at the third stage of the delivery when the placenta is not loosened and the uterus is not contracted. The parity is of no importance. The first symptom usually is shock which not always&amp;nbsp;is proportional to the bleeding. Also fibrinolytic blood coagulation defects are mentioned. The diagnosis is evident when the uterus is found in or outside the vagina. The treatment is manual reposition as soon as possible after the shock has been treated. The two reported cases are both puerperal inversions. The first, para 2, was admitted in shocked condition. The reposition was easy and no complications occured, while the other case was a para 4 complicated with a fibroma of the uterus. This patient died after the reposition was made as it was not possible to treat the shock adequately.",

    "abstract": "The present paper deals with the results of an archaeological investigation carried out in 1957, of a settlement in a place called vi\u00f0 Hanus\u00e1, Seyrv\u00e1gur (on the island of V\u00e1gar), situated high in the cultivated area. (fig. 1).\r\nThe site was very much disturbed, partly owing to tilling during centuries so that only the foundation stones of the walls were preserved in many places not as much as that (fig. 3), partly owing to recent building work, by which the site had among things been intersected by a wide cementated drainage ditch (fig. 2 and fig. 3).\r\nThe sections (fig. 2) also show that the walls are founded direct on oraine clay, and that the top soil is very shallow in most places. As appears from the sketch plan (fig. 3), the house is oriented N\u2014S, the southern end fronting the below beach and creek. The whole length of the house is 17.75 metres and full breadth 6.70 metres inside; but the character of the walls and the extent of the floor layers show that we have to do with a building of an earlier date, to which extensions have later been added to the east and to the south.\r\nThe oldest building stretches from abt. y 20.75 metres north till abt. &amp;nbsp;3.50 metres south, its inside length being abt. 14.50 metres and the breadth 4.50 meteres at y 16 metres (fig. 3). Although the western wall is but partly preserved and the easternwall has been rearranged during later rebuilding, it seems obvious that the ground-plan of the house has been oval. The walls of this building are filling walls of 1.5 metres thickness, particularly distinct are the northern wall and the remains of the western wall at the north and at the south end (fig. 3 and fig. 4). The only fireplace is a longitudinal one of 3.70 metres length, placed n the central axis of the house (fig. 5).\r\nTwo parallel rows of posts have carried the roof, and it is proved that some of the posts were partly supported by flat stones (fig. 3, x 5 - y 9.75 metres). As in any case one of them (fig. 3, x 7.35 - y 17.5 metres) was charred and the layers around consisted of fat black earth containing charcoal (fig. 2, section y 16 metres, farthest to the east), it seems as if at least the northern part of the house has been burnt down, which perhaps also gives an explanation as to the alteration of ground-plan and lay-out of the house, an alteration which, if that is the case, may be made during the reconstruction.\r\nAs is well-known buildings of this character and type (oval groundplan) are to be found in all the Northern countries in the Viking period, the best examples in the Faroe Islands being found in Kv\u00edv\u00edk1 and in Fuglafjor\u00f0ur3; therefore, it is very likely that the earliest part of the present building dates from the Viking period but it has also been in&amp;nbsp;habited in the Middle Ages. Fragments of earthen vessels (list of finds No. 11, 42 and 48) and some spinning-wheels, probably lead weights in particular(list of finds No. 22) also speek in favour of this dating.",

From Germany came also the printed sources of the saga of St. Anne in Holm 3 fol., the big collection of Saints' Lives, and it was recently distovered that the main source, the almost unique St. Annen Biichlein in Low German (Braunschweig 1507) was also the only source of a saga of St. Anne in AM 82,8\u00b0 (on paper, 17th cent). This version had erronously been described as a Mar\u00edu saga, but is in fact a parallel to the fragmentary text in AM 238 fol III that can now be supplemented, so that it is possible to gain an almost complete idea of the composition and contents of this older, Icelandic saga of St. Anne (from c. 1500). A summary of the version in AM 82 concludes the paper.",

Out of the approximately 2000 names of parts of the old infield recorded in conjunction with the appraisement abt. one third are names indicating the situation of the fields and abt. one third reflect ownership. Field names of which personal names form part, constitute half of the names suggesting ownership, which seems to show that each named piece of ground was originally owned by a person. Within the other half of the names indicating ownership, some names are to be found which show that the land belonged formerly to the Church, some which show that the land was owned by a person outside the community, and a few indicate noble ownership.\r\nHalf of the remaining third of the field names (i. e. one sixth of all names) consists of qualificatory names, i. e. names giving the qualities of the soil, extent of tilling etc. The last sixth of the names form a heterogeneous group. We find among these names abt. 100 having relation to plants and animals, domestic as well as wild animals. Among the animal names it is worth pointing out some names referring to pig=keeping, although pigskeeping was presumably given up in the Faroes about the Reformation.\r\nAmong the plant names we find some which have relation to the growing of angelica, and a single one which seems to show that flax was formerly grown in the Faroes. A closer study of the field names is not likely to change the picture of the development ownership and the agricultural history very much, but will supplement this picture in several respects.",

    "abstract": "Jakob Jakobsen's pioneer work on Shetland Norn has been of lasting value, not only to linguistic research, but also to the science of folklore. It is in keeping with the quality of his fieldwork, the completeness of his collections, and the systematization of the cultural historical back\u00bb ground material for the sphere of linguistics. His precise information has made it possible to place a number of folklore fragments in Norn, which would have been difficult or impossible to identify if they had beenleft scattered. Among these are a Nordic medieval ballad, known in Norwegian as &quot;Hustru kan deile med sin bonde&quot;, in Faroese as &quot;H\u00fastr\u00fa og b\u00f3ndi&quot;, and the legend of the death of the great Pan. At the same time, Jakobsen's evidence that the sources of Shetland Norn are strongly represented in dialects of southwestern Norway (Agder\u2014Rogaland) has been of great help in fixing the provenience of certain nursery rhymes in a highly corrupt Norn. These rhymes are easily recognizable when we compare them with Norwegian variants. And the Norwegian variants are markedly associated with the geograps hical area in which the dialects have linguistic connection with Shetland Nom. These folklore texts thus confirm Jakobsen's theory.",

    "abstract": "In this article the author gives us examples from an investigation of Faroese folktale-tellers, mainly of those people who were the informants of the Faroese philologist Dr. Jakob Jakobsen. His folktale material, collected in the last decade of the I9th century, kept in Landsb\u00f3kasavn in T\u00f3rshavn and for the most part published in sF\u00e6roske Folkesagn og \u00c6ventyr\u00ab 1898\u20141901, is the basis of a comparative investigation of the Faroese folktales, in which that examination of person and milieu is a complementary part. By means of excursions and questionnaires the author has completed Dr. Jakobsens' collection and taken up biographical information about folktale-tellers.\nThe greater part of Dr. Jakobsens's tellers have been women, many of them unmarried servants. To a large extent also later records have had female informants. The oldest teller of the material collected up til now, Johanne Joensdatter from Kv\u00edv\u00edk, Streymoy, was born in 1790 and died in 1869 at Sorv\u00e1gur, V\u00e1gar. Nevertheless, the greatest number of folktales has been told by a man, J. H. Matras, born in 1823 at Vi\u00f0arei\u00f0i, Vi\u00f0oy, and dead in 1901 at Kirkja, Fugloy. The tellers inquired for do not seem to have had a very close contactwith literature \u2014 apart from the Bible, the hymn-book and the book of homilies.\nDuring the 19th century the school attendance was imperfect. Generally the children w'ere taught by their parents at least to be able to read. The written language and the church language of the Faroe Isles at that time was Danish. Not until the letter part of the 19th century the Faroese spoken language started to be used as written language and in 1938 as school language.\nThe biographical statements show that the persons inpuired for and their nearest relatives backwards in time have lived rather isolated, many of them have hardly ever left their native places. Certainly a change of dwelling place has been made in not a few cases, especially on the mothers' side, but that has taken place within a relatively limited area. Marriages to foreigners do not seem to have been common among these people for the three generations that have been inquired for.\nThe article ends with an appeal to people who know Faroese folktales and folktale-tellers from old and recent time to send in complementary and corrective informations to the author via F\u00f8roya Fornminnissavn in T\u00f3rshavn.",

    "abstract": "The forms of the ON verb finna: fundu (pret. plur.) and fundinn (past part.) alternate with funnu and funninn. It is demonstrated that the latter forms are the younger ones, and this raises the question whether it is possible to show when and where the younger forms are first found. A careful investigation of the oldest MSS shows that the younger forms, funnu and funninn, can be found in Norwegian MSS of an earlier date than those Icelandic ones in which the forms occur. However, in a group of Icelandic MSS funnu and fundu are used alternately, even in Kringla and other MSS of the Heimskringla. This&amp;nbsp;may be due to a general Norwegian influence on the language, or to a specific influence from the (Norwegian) MSS from which the text was copied. In connection with the dating and provenance, of the younger forms it is perhaps significant that they are the standard forms of modern Farocse, and that Jakob Jakobsen has recorded the past participle in a form corresponding to ON funninn in the Norse language of the Shetland Islands.",

This verb thus seems to have existed in spoken Icelandic from the Sagatime; and the translation by Bj\u00f3rn Halld\u00f3rsson (who lived in NWIceland) seems to indicate that he knew the verb not only from V\u00edga-Gl\u00fams saga, but also from contemporary speech. Finally, it is suggested that hr\u00f3\u00f0rskotat in the verse might mean something like 'disarranged', which would be more natural in the context and closer to the modern Icelandic meaning than the commonly accepted interpretation ('disgraced', 'disparaged').",

    "abstract": "In the present paper is discussed the language of a medieval document, the H\u00fasav\u00edk letters (\u00bbH\u00fasav\u00edksbr\u00f3vini\u00ab), which is a transcript, dated in T\u00f3rshavn in 1407, of six legal documents written in 1403\u2014 a 1405 in the Faroes and Shetland. The H\u00fasav\u00edk letters concern the {Jj legacy from Gu\u00f0run Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir at H\u00fasav\u00edk in Sandoy, who was famous for her wealth. The document, which is kept in the University Library in Copenhagen (AM, fasc. 100, 2a), was published by the Faroese philologist; Jakob Jakobsen in Diplomatarium F\u00e6roense I in 1907. Jakobsen characsterized the language used in the H\u00fasav\u00edk letters and other medieval documents from the Faroes as \u00bb01d Norse, sometimes with Faroese features\u00ab (e. g. i instead of e in \u00bbskilgitin\u00ab / true=born / Old Norse skilgetin and \u00bbgingin\u00ab /gone/ Old Norse gengin; \u00bbdeydh\u00ab / dead / for Old Norse dau\u00f0; \u00bbtoa\u00ab and \u00bbbrier\u00ab /three/ for Old Norse tv\u00e1 and /&amp;gt;r\u00edr).\r\nIn a review of Jakobsen's book Marius H\u00e6gstad examined the language of the H\u00fasav\u00edk letters. He concluded that the transcript had been written by a Norwegian hand, as he found so many forms that were unknown in the North Germanic dialects west of Norway, above all the considerable number of words without mutation of a to o (or \u00f3) when u follows in the next syllable. (Forms like \u00bbannur\u00ab and \u00bballum\u00ab for onnur and ollum)\r\nAnother Norwegian scholar, Mikjel Sorlie, finds it most probable that the writer of the transcript was a Faroese. The author of the present paper discusses the different features in the H\u00fasav\u00edk letters, and points out that research work in recent times shows us that forms without mutation of a may be found also in western old colonies of Norway, e. g. in Svabo's 18 th century records of Faroese ballads. Also to other \u00bbNorwegian\u00ab features in the H\u00fasav\u00edk letters we may find Faroese equivalents in the ballads and in the spoken laguage of today. It is important to consider the cultural relations between Norway and the Faroes in the Middle Ages. Since 1035 the Faroes constituted part of the Norwegian kingdom, and Norwegian laws were in force in the islands. We may suppose that the Faroese took Norwegian documents as patterns when writing. Thus Faroese features, thoughdivergent from Norwegian, may be concealed by traditional spelling. This considered it seems most likely that a Faroese wrote the transcript of the H\u00fasav\u00edk letters. The document is of great interest, not only for the vivid picture it shows us of life in the Faroes in the Middle Ages, but also for what it teaches us about the Faroese language of that period.",

    "abstract": "In 1823 Johan Henrik Schroter published his translation into Faroese of The Gospel of St. Matthew. Schr\u00f3ter was the first one who tried to establish a Faroese orthography for public use (e. g. in print), an undertaking which involved a great many problems. Moreover the population disliked the use of their own vernacular in The Holy Scriptures, and the linguists (e g. P. A. Munch, Ivar Aasen and N. M. Petersen) disliked the ortophone spelling which, according to their theories, represented a mixture of linguistic structures.\r\nThe translation was carried out 1815\u201423. The original MS was provided with a preface and linguistic remarks, none of which were included in the printed edition. From this preface (printed in this pnper) and the remarks (from which characteristic examples are given) we learn a great deal about Schr\u00f3ter's methods and reasons for his choice of words and phrases.\r\nSome characteristic features of Schr\u00f3ter's translation are referred and discussed. The tendency is that loanwords and more literary expressions are to be found in the abstract and specific religious parts of the text. The genuine Farose words and phrases (of which some were characterized as oldfashioned and obsolete) are to be found in the narration and in parts wheie concrete situations and objects are described.",

    "abstract": "A ballad about J\u00f3frey has been recorded in three Faroese versions from the first half of the 19th century, as well as in two Icelandic from ca. 1700. Two of the Faroese texts have been published, while the lcelandic ones have not been until now. The principal aim of the present article is to publish them.\r\nIn reproducing the content of the ballad, all texts have been used. A young man named J\u00f3frey (J\u00f3fr\u00ed, J\u00f3svein) is being brought up by a king who shows him great favor. J\u00f3frey and the king's daughter, \u00d3lof (\u00d3luva), fall in love with each other. During a ride through a forest, two of the king's men, Sveinn and \u00c1lfur, tell the king that J\u00f3frey has been sleeping with \u00d3lof, and remind him that J\u00f3frey is not worthy of her. The king decides to give a big feast at which \u00d3l\u00f3f is also to be present and J\u00f3frey is to be punished with death. During the feast the king gives his daughter orders to choose a husband, and she openly declares her love for J\u00f3frey. When the king commands that J\u00f3frey is to be bound, the latter seizes his weapons and slays Sveinn and \u00c1lfur(as well as the king's other men, according to the Icelandic texts). The king pleads for mercy and gives his daughter to J\u00f3frey.All the texts, both the Icelandic and the Faroese, clearly have been written down from oral tradition with many corruptions. In the title in one of the Icelandic texts it is stated that the ballad was translated from Danish. No Danish text has, however, been preserved, but it is probable that the ballad was imported. This is indicated by the verse form which stems from Latin sequences and is well-known from Danish and Swedish poetry from the 15th and 16th centuries but was not used in Iceland or the Faroes (a single Icelandic poem about the holy Cross is, however, written in a related verse form). It is pointed out thatboth the Icelandic and the Faroese texts seem to presuppose the old syllabic quantity which in Icelandic began to break down in the 16th century, while it is not known when this took place in Faroese.",

    "abstract": "The Faroese verb s\u00falunda, \u00bbdestroy, waste, ruin,\u00ab with its Icelandic parallel s\u00f3lunda, has most probably its origin in the Viking age. For technical reasons a word of this category must be derived from a noun s\u00falund or s\u00f3lund (cf. pfunda, vb., from pfund, fem.; t\u00edunda, vb., from t\u00edund, fem.). An apellative s\u00falund (or s\u00f3lund) is not known, and has probably never existed. The verb s\u00falunda is therefore best explained as a derivative of a place*name S\u00falund : S\u00f3lund (with the suffix -und, fem., a wellsknown element in several Scandinavian nanies, especially of islands) A quite famous example is Suhn, the name of a group of islands outside the Sognefiord in Norway. The modern Norwegian form of the name goes back to a mediaeval form S\u00falund, sing., cf.the plural \u00bbi Sulundum\u00ab (Hauksb\u00f3k, p. 335). All other extant mediaeval forms are spelled with =\u00f3=: S\u00f3lund, sing., has only been recorded once (in the enumeration of islands in Snorra Edda II, 492), and S\u00f3lundar--, gen., twice (\u00bbS\u00f3lundar haf\u00ab in H\u00e1konar saga H\u00e1konarsonar, and \u00bbS\u00f3lundar sund\u00ab in one of the stanzas in Korm\u00e1ks saga), in all other instances the plural is used both in Icelandic and Norwegian sources from the Middle Ages: S\u00f3lundir and one example of S\u00f3lundar. According to Landn\u00e1ma and the Kings' Sagas ships used to gather near S\u00f3lundir before they set out for the voyage to the west. In Historia Norwegi\u00e6, a description of Norway and Norwegian history written in the 12th or 13th century only known from an Orcadian MS (15th cent.),it is explained why the sea between Norway and Ireland was called S\u00f3lundarhaf: \u00bbSunt ergo insulae praeiacentes Gulaciae, quae ab incolis Solundae nominantur, unde Solundicum mare dictum, quod inter Norvegiam et Iberniam fluit, in quo sunt Orchades insulae.\u00ab Also in this&amp;nbsp;text the name is spelled with =\u00f3*, and if the form reflects Orcadian tradition, people in the Orkneys must have said S\u00f3lundarhaf, and not S\u00falundarhaf as their kinsmen in the Faroes did, since the Faroese verb s\u00falunda can only be derived from the form S\u00falund. The Icelandic verb s\u00f3lunda, \u00bbperdere, jacturam facere,\u00ab was already in the 17th century explained as a derivative of the Norwegian placename S\u00f3lundir, \u00bbeo qvod Naves ibi s\u00e6pe pereant\u00ab (Gu\u00f0mundur Andresson), \u00bbpar voru opt r\u00e6nd skip, pvi er sagt ba\u00f0 s\u00f3lundist sem fer(vocabulary in AM 738,4\u00b0).",

    "abstract": "1. Haukr Erlendsson is mentioned for the first time in the sources as lawman in Iceland in 1294, but about 1300 he moved to Norway, where he lived for most of the time until his death in 1334. Two letters and parts of two books in his hand are extant.\r\n2. His autograph letters were written in Norway in 1302 and 1310, and two differences can be seen in their scribal habits, one concerned with a curve in the down-stroke of the letters /, p and }&amp;gt;, and the other with the ofe abbreviation.\r\n3. The name Hauksb\u00f3k is applied to the manuscripts AM 371 4to, 544 4to and 675 4to, of which the whole of 371 and parts of 544 are written in Haukr Erlendsson's own hand. On a single side of 544, f34r (Hbl), both the pal\u00e6ographic criteria mentioned above show agreement with the letter of 1302, while the whole of 371 and the greater part of Haukr's portion of 544 (Hb2) agree vvith the older letter on one point (the ok abbreviation) but with the younger on the other. ff60-68 of 544 (Hb3) are in agreement with the letter of 1310 on both points.\r\nFrom this it may be concluded that Hbl was written about or before 1302, Hb2 in the period 1302\u201410 \u2014 probably at Ieast part of it in 1306\u201408, when H. E. was staying in Iceland; nearly all, if not all the material in Hb2 is Icelandic \u2014 and Hb3 about or after 1310. These dates are consistent with the compilation of the codex and with earlier dating based on internal evidence. Hb3 shows some examples of Norwegian-influenced word-forms which are not found in Hbl and 2, and its exemplar may have been Norwegian.\r\n4. In Riksarkivet in Oslo there are some fragments of a Norwegian law-book in H. E.'s hand; these may be dated, on the basis of the same criteria, to the period 1302\u201410.",

This Rich J\u00e1kup is said to have been a poor man's child from the village of Velbasta\u00f0, who for some years worked as a \u00bbhouse\u00bbkarl\u00ab at Hoyv\u00edk and later married a woman from Selatra\u00f0 and went to live there. When hunger prevailed in the islands, he sold halftainted food to poor people takint; their fields in return and thus amassing 60 \u00bbmerkur\u00ab (a \u00bbm\u00f8rk\u00ab is the basic unit of land valuation) of \u00bb\u00f3\u00f0alsj\u00f8r\u00f0\u00ab (i. e private land in contrast to \u00bbkongsj\u00f8r\u00f0\u00ab, which was land belonging to the Crown).\r\nIn old land registers and records of the Thing (formerly acting as a court) we find historical information \u2014 some of it from his own mouth \u2014 confirming that on the whole the legend is true, except as regards his native village and the purchase of land.J\u00e1kup with the family name Zachariassen was born in 1616 or 1617&amp;nbsp;at Kaldbak of poor parents. From 1631 he served as a \u00bbhouse\u00abkarl\u00ab at Hoyv\u00edk for 10 years. In 1642 or 1643 he married a farmer's widow at Selatra\u00f0, and gradually he obtained copyhold of all \u00bbkongs\u00ab holdings in that village. We do not know for certain how much land Rich J\u00e1kup owned, but the greater part of his property was not extorted from starving people. During the years from 1667 to 1678 he bought from the merchant Severin Lauridsen Fohrmann and others 46 \u00bbmerkur\u00ab of land, formerly owned in the Faroes by DanishsNorwegian noblefamilies.\r\nJ\u00e1kup died in 1699, 82 or 83 years old according to himself, but the parish register states his age at 108 years!",

    "abstract": "For centuries the Faroese \u00bbfuglastong\u00ab (an instrument used in birdcatching) has been of vital importance to the Faroese population. We do not know how long it has been used in the Faroe Islands. Several place-names bear witness of this fowling method in the Faroe Islands (Matras 1933), and 300 years ago the \u00bbfuglastong\u00ab is mentionned in Tarnovius (1669). \u2014 As far as we know the \u00bbfuglastong\u00ab has not been used by other coastal populations round the Atlantic Ocean than the Faroese, until 1875 when it was introduced into Iceland (Johnson 1946) from the Faroe Islands.\r\nThe above article draws a comparison between the Faroese and the Japanese \u00bbfuglastong\u00ab. \u2014 Fig. 1 and 2 show the Faroese \u00bbfuglastong\u00ab and fig. 3 and 4 the Japanese. The drawing of the latter dates from 1897 (Machpherson 1897). \u2014 For at least 300 years the shape of the Faroese \u00bbfuglastong\u00ab has been practically unchanged.\r\nAll the main components of the Faroese and the Japanese \u00bbfuglastong\u00ab are identical. They are (see fig. 2): a handle (stangartr\u00e6i\u00f0 VIII), a pair of ash supports or arms (sfangararmarnir III), a so&amp;gt;called horn (horni\u00f0 VI), (the Japanese \u00bbfuglastong\u00ab has a crossbar that serves the same purpose), a net (neti\u00f0 II), a cord drawn through the meshes of the netand connecting the front ends of the arms (fyritr\u00e1\u00f0urin I), a cord drown through the meshes nearest to the horn and fastened to it (k\u00f3sarbandi\u00f0 IV), a cord with which the arms are bound to the handle (vavi\u00f0 or \u00edbindits VII).\r\nIt has been held that the \u00bbfuglastong\u00ab was of Faroese invention and only to be found in the Faroe Islands until it came to Iceland from here. The fact that an almost identical instrument is also used in Japan, raises the question whether there is any connection between these two instruments or whether the very great similiarily of the Faroese and the Japanese \u00bbfuglastong\u00ab is a mere coincidence. The present writer would appreciate every information that might throw light on this question. (Adress: Klaksv\u00edk, the Faroe Islands).",

    "abstract": "Information from books mentionned in the Bibliography as well as my own notes, which I owe to old people from some villages (see footnote on page 63), provide the material for this paper. The pattern of life and work in the old Faroese peasant community had been pnctically unchanged for centuries when, in the middle of the 19th century, changes set in, especially after 1870 when the Faroese had begun fishery from decked vessels.\r\nIn older days the work was organized in such a way that male and female servants were ordered to perform a certain amount of work a day. They were as well ordered to perform a certain amount of work for a winter evening. These works were known under the names of \u00bbdagssetningur\u00ab and \u00bbkv\u00f8ldsetningur\u00ab respectively (what has been set up for a cfay's work, and what has been set up for an evening's work).\r\nThis paper gives an account of \u00bbsetningar\u00ab with regard to carding, spinning, knitting, weaving, cultivating, turfscutting, bird*plucking, haycutting, cornscutting, \u00bbat ripa\u00ab (pressing the straws of the barley through the teeth of a special comb in order to wrench off the ears), \u00bbat lata av sorni\u00ab (preparing the corn for milling), \u00bbat raka neytsh\u00fa\u00f0\u00ab (removing the hairs fram the cow's hide), \u00bbat raka sey\u00f0askinn\u00ab (removing the hairs from the sheep's skin), slaughtering, and kneading tallow. Finally\u00bbsetningar\u00ab for children are mentionned, and it is pointed out that whenever possible it has been decided by \u00bbsetningar\u00ab how much work was to be done a day. As to outdoor work the working conditions were very unlike over the islands so that the \u00bbsetningar\u00ab could not be identical, which leads to \u00bbsetningar\u00ab attached to localities. An example is to be found in the paper.",

    "abstract": "The socalled beak duty was an obligation for all grownsup men in the Faroe Islands to deliver one beak of a raven (corvus corax varius) a year. The duty is mentionned as early as in Olaus Magnus (1555), who, to be sure, traces it to Iceland, and presumably it is of mediaeval origin. It was imposed for the purpose of reducing the damage caused to the stock of sheep by the ravens, which especially killed the young lambs. The payment of the beak duty had to be enjoined several times in the course of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century, whereupon detailed rules were laid down by Royal Ordinance of November 21, 1741. Pursuant to this ordinance it was possible in addition to beaks of ravens to deliver beaks of eagles (haliaeetus albicilla), of crows (corvus cornix cornix), and of blackbacks (larus marinus). The provision of the ordinance regarding the eagle was of little importance, this bird being already at that time extirpated as a breeding bird, and complete agreement does not seem to have prevailed as to the noxiousness of the crow and the blackback to the stock of sheep. Besides these birds, the great skua (stercorarius skua skua) is known to have been under the beak duty, which, to all appearance, contributed towardsits almost complete extirpation so that a preservation of it had to be effected in 1897, with the result that the stock of this bird has increased again. Svabo suggested about 1780 that the lesser black^backed gull (larus fuscus graellsii) ought to come under the beak duty, too, but his proposal was not carried through. Besides, opinions differed on the noxiousness of this bird. The beak duty was abolished by an Act in 1881, the opinion being that the system gave too much trouble and that it was not necessary any longer. The latter supposition was not right, however, and an awarding of prizes had to be introduced immediately, and it was also necessary by and Act of March 11, 1892 to put landowners under the obligation to seek out the nests of the raven and to destroy the brood. However, this act was never applied to any great extent, whereas the awardingof prizes has been maintained up to our time. At present small prizes are awarded for deliveries of beaks both of the raven and of the crow.",

    "abstract": "In the present paper is given a short survey of the history of fishery limits, with special reference to the fishery limits of the Faeroe Islands. The author then proceeds to discuss the validity under international law of the new Faeroese fishery limit which came into force on March 12, 1964.&amp;nbsp;\r\nIn the historical context a fundamental difference in the traditional views held by the European countries on the coastal fisheries, is underlined. It is a welhknown fact that the coastal fisheries in Europe from the middle ages up to the 17th century \u2014 when the concept of the&amp;nbsp;regime of the territorial sea was developed \u2014 were as a general rule free for everybody to take part in, natives and foreigners alike. This was the case, for instance, in England and Denmark. The general rule had, however, some significant exceptions, in which cases the coastal fisheries had, as far back as we know, been reserved for the coastalpopulations. These exceptions were Norway and the Norwegian settle\u00bb ments in the Atlantic ocean, Scotland, and the Scottish isles. In these regions the fisheries were of quite another importance to the population than in the rest of the European countries As the Norwegian author, Dr. Arnold R\u00e6stad, puts it: 'The sea was to the Norwegians, the Ice\u00bb landers, and the Scots the daily life and the daily bread'.\r\nDuring the United Nations conference in 1958 on the law of the sea, the fact emerged that the Faroese people today, as far as the economic importance of sea fisheries is concerned, take up a singular position among the nations. According to an F. A. O. report, produced during this conference, on 'The Economic Importance of the Sea Fisheries in Different Countries', the sea fishery landings in the Faroe Islands in 1956 had a total weight of 116,000 tons. This gave the islands with their population of only 32,000 a place in the group of countries and other territories, 34 in all, each producing more than 100,000 tons of fish a year. In this group coastal states such as Greece, Belgium, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia were not to be found.\r\nFurthermore, the Faroese catch in 1956 amounted to 3.5 tons per inhabitant, which was the highest figure of its kind in the report. In the total exports of the islands in the years 1952\u20141956 the fishery products occupied a share varying from 95 up to 99 per cent. The terrestrial resources of the Faroe Islands are meagre in the extreme. Throughout the centuries the resources of the Faroese fishing grounds have been to the islanders what the terrestrial resources have been to other nations. It is an old and still valid saying in the islands that 'the Faroe man has his foodsstore in the sea'.\r\nIn the course of the 17th century the exclusive fishing rights of the Faroese were recognised on an international level. Following a coms plaint from the Faroese against Scottish fishermen, James the First and the Scottish Privy Council in 1618 issued a proclamation forbidding Scottish fishermen to fish within sight of land of the Faroe Islands.\r\nUp to the middle of the 19th century Danish men=ofswar on inspection tours in the North Atlantic had instructions to protect a 16-mile fishery limit off the Faroe Islands and Iceland. In the last decade of the 19th century the first foreign steam\u00abtrawlersappeared in Faroese and Icelandic waters. In his book The sovereignty of the sea, T. W. Fulton gives the information that the catches of these trawlers were enormous. The reaction of the local population is expressed in a report from the 'L\u00f8gting' of the Faroe Islands in 1898: ' . . . The procedure of the trawlers is most rational. Some ten ships gather side by side with just so much space between them that their gear does not collide. They are then trawling in the same direction, all of them . . . In the early summer the prospects of a good catch of haddock in the waters north of the islands were promising; but this fishery has failed totally as a result of the activity of the trawlers . . . The summer fishery has miscarried . . . and it is to be fearedthat next year's fishery has been destroyed too . . . '.\r\nIn 1901 the Faroese fishery limit according to a convention between Great Britain and Denmark was fixed at 3 miles. According to a convention from 1955 this limit got certain local extensions (see map).\r\nIn 1959 Great Britain and Denmark agreed upon a Faroese fishery limit of 12 miles in relation to other countries than Great Britain, and 6 miles with certain extensions in relation to Great Britain (see map). According to a convention in 1961 between Great Britain and Iceland, Great Britain has recognised that Iceland has a fishery limit of 12 miles measured from straight baselines. As far as Great Britain is concerned, this limit came into full force on March 12, 1964. Denmark has unilaterally decided that the Faroese fishery limit from the same day is 12 miles measured from straight baselines drawn around theislands as a whole (see map). This decision was not made till Denmark had tried in vain to get an agreement with Great Britain similar to the one between Iceland and Great Britain.\r\nDuring the Geneva conferences on the law of the sea much sympathetic attention was given to the case of the isolated islands in the North Atlantic, where the fisheries are the only staple industry. On the 1958 conference a resolution was passed, dealing with these special cases (see appendix). But no provision of special fishery limits in these cases was agreed upon.\r\nDe lege lata it is not warranted to establish a special Faroese fishery limit on grounds of necessity or similar criteria. The author, however, defends the opinion that the new Faroese limit is not contrary to the general rules of international law. He makes the allegation that the validity as to non=signatory states of the 12 miles fishery limit, recently agreed upon in London by most of the states of Western Europe, presupposes that a territorial limit of 12 miles is not contrary to international law, as the justification of a unilaterally fixed fishery limit is to be found in the assumption that the coastal state has a right to a territorial limit of the same extension, a right which it arbitrarily chooses to use in regard to fisheries only. The validity of the straight baselines, drawn around the Faroe Islands as a whole, the author bases upon an analogy from article 4 in the convention on the territorial sea and the contiguous zone, adopted by the 1958 Geneva conference&amp;nbsp;on the law of the sea. He contends that the baselines do not to any appreciable extent depart from the general direction of the Faroese coastline (article 4, section 2), and that the 60 mile-long baseline to the east is justified by the traditional and unique importance of the coastal fisheries to the habitability of the islands (article 4, section 4).",

    "abstract": "A historical review of toxoplasmosis is given, from the discovery of the parasite toxoplasma gondii in 1908 (Nicolle and Manceaux, North Africa, and Splendore, Brazil). Nicolle and Manceaux detected toxoplasma gondii among North African rodents, and Splendore found them among Brazilian rabbits. Since then numerous publications have been brought forward demonstrating toxoplasma gondii among hares, rats, pigeons, dogs, rabbits, hens, pigs, cows, sheep, minks, and cats.\r\nIn 1937 the first case of congenital toxoplasmosis was published, and in 1941 the first case of acquired toxoplasmosis described. Afterwards numerous cased have been published. In 1953 R. K. Rasmussen M. D.&amp;nbsp;published the first case in the Faroe Islands. Toxoplasmosis is a rather new disease and its syndrome rather varied. During recent years 5 different types of the disease have been stated. To be sure, it is a rare disease, but is often overlooked. It is maintained that in Scandinavialymphoadenophaty is more frequent than myalgia, arthralgia, myocars ditis, and encephalitis. This is hardly correct; especially the encephalitic cases are often overlooked. The author describes 5 cases from the Faroe Islands. Next a typical pathological picture is instanced. First the patient is tired and irritable, a few days Iater a severe headache appears, followed by nausea and vomiting. Faints occur followed by convulsions, and many patients get heart troubles. Often the patients are removed to hospital for heart diseases or epilepsy. Finally is emphasized that the disease is more frequent than it is diagnosed.",

    "abstract": "In the paper above a survey is given of the different Scandinavian and other Germanic names for 'buttermilk'. There are no traces of a common word in the Western Scandinavian languages in their older stages, the only surviving older words are Norw. saup, n., Icel. \u00e1(f)ir, f.pl., and Far. blak, n. \u2014 Alexander Bugge showed (Vesterlandenes Indflydelse, 1904, p. 358) that the Faroese word was borrowed from Gaelic.\r\nIt is suggested in the present paper that blak is derived from *bla\u00f0ak (from Gaelic bl\u00e1thach) and contracted to one syllable after the disappearing of \u00f0 (in the 16th cent). It is difficult to explain that the former vowel in the Faroese word is short, but long in the Gaelic equivalent. In the appendix it is demonstrated that the word kjarni, m. 'churn' is a ghostword, owing its existence to a wrongly interpreted word in the Thomas Saga: kjarnamjolk \u2014 corresponding to lac amygdalorum (literally 'almond milk') in the Latin source.",

The course of the disease, however, seems to be milder, especially with regard to changes in the optic fundi (hemorrhages and exudates), even if the patients have had the disease for several years. Changes in the electrocardiogram and X=ray of the heart run proportionally with the severity of the hypertension. An apparently mild hypertension can in a couple of years develop info a malignant one,frequently among females between 50 and 60 years of age. I suppose that the milder course, especially with regard to the eyeground, may be due to other habits of eating in the Faroe Islands than in other western countries. The most important difference is the intake of unsaturated fatty acids6. In this connection it is emphasized that retinopathia diabetica is seldom seen in this country, even if the patients have had diabetes mellitus for many years; perhaps it is also due to the intake of the above-mentioned food, which possibly protects against arterio\u00edsclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Originaire de DEBES (1673), le mot \u00e1'imbrim (plongeon imbrin) a suivi deux cours differents.

    "abstract": "The weak*stressed vowels i and u are often confused in modern Faroese. This has been observed many times, first by Rasmus Rask in 1811. In the present article this problem is discussed mainly from purely phonetic and phonemic points of view, but also geographica), historical, and sociological points of view have been taken into consideration.\r\nBy means of a tape recorder the author has investigated the pronunciation of a large number of Faroese. The pronunciation of \u00ed and u varies very much. The aim is to describe these varieties and, to some extent, explain their occurrence. It is very important to consider the degree of stress of the weaksstressed syllables. A difference is observed between \u00bblevis\u00ab (traditionally weak\u00bbstressed syllable in a dissyllabic word, or the more stressed syllable among the weaksstressed ones inlonger words) and \u00bblevissimus\u00ab (totally unstressed syllable). There is often a difference also between open syllables and closed syllables in the pronunciation of weaksstressed / and u.&amp;nbsp;\r\nThe m.iin part of the article is a presentation of the result of a phonemic investigation made in 1961. Faroese school teachers asked people in 34 villages about their pronunciation and filled out a questionnaire, containing a large number of words with the most common endings, =ir, sur, =i'n, *um, \u00c1 \\ , =U\\, -i, and =u. There was no need to describe the finer shades of sound used for i and u of the written language; the only important point was to decide, whether the vowel pronunced was to be interpreted as an issound or an u=sound.\r\nIn three different areas weaksstressed i and u are pronounced alike in most endings. These areas are: l) T\u00f3rshavn and the neighbouring villages; 2) the villages in Vi\u00f0oy and Bor\u00f0oy; perhaps should also a few other villages in the Nor\u00f0uroyar be included here; 3) Su\u00f0uroy. In these areas as a rule no difference in pronunciation is made between -ir and \u25a0\u25a0uv, --il and -u\\, etc. In areas l) and 2) a weakstressed i or u is usually pronounced as a kind of i'\u00bbsound, in area 3) as a kind of u-sound.\r\nIn the main part of the Faroe Isles the letters i' and u in \u00bblevis\u00ab are treated as different phonemes. However, the dialects do not maintain the same distribution of isendings and u=endings as the written language, the spelling of which is based on historical principles. Thus, for instance, the endings --irl-.ur are pronounced Ar in the plural of nouns, but sur in the present tense of verbs in the dialects of Sandoy and V\u00e1gar.\r\nIn totall\u00fd unstressed syllables (\u00bblevissimus\u00ab) no difference in pro; nunciation is made between i' and u in the dialects. Forms like hestinum and hestunum are pronounced alike, and it is only from the context that we can conclude, whether the word is in the singular or in the plural.",

    "abstract": "In the 17th century the Faroese Lawting (High Court) was held on July 29th (St. Olav's Day) and during the following week. Each day in the morning the members of the Lawthing attended divine service, and the proceedings of the Lawth\u00edng were held in the afternoon.&amp;nbsp;\r\nThis article deals with the fact that according to the lawbook then in force in the Faroe Islands the lawthings were to begin on June 16th&amp;nbsp;(the day before St. Botulph's Day), and the proceedings were to last from 6 a. m. to 3 p. m. These provisions are found in the lawbook, or code, of the Norwegian king Magnus the Lawmender, the Gulathing edition (A. D. 1274), which was clearly the lawbook of the Faroe Islands.\r\nIn a new edition of this code, given in Danish A. D. 1604 by Christian IV, king of Denmark and Norway, the sessions were ordered to be held from 6 a. m. to noon.\r\nTo explain why the Faroese Lawthing custom did not conform with the general law, it is necessary to consider the evidence of an old religious guild in the Faroe Islands. The sessions of the Lawthing were held in the open air or, weather not permitting, in a house called The Guild Hall, until this house was destroyed by fire in 1672. When the Lawthing had ended its proceedings, a feast was held in this hall, conducted by a person called the Alderman (not by the president of the Lawthing). The alderman greeted those present as guild brethren and guild sisters, following ancient guild rites.\r\nIt is suggested that there must have been a mediaeval guild in the Faroe Islands dedicated to St. Olav and meeting during the week from July 29th (Olavsvaka, Olavi regis) to August 5th (Octava Olavi). The minor Olav's mass (Translatio Olavi) was on August 3rd. Reference is made to the mediaeval rules of an Olav's Guild in Hordaland, Norway.\r\nThe Olav's Guild in the Faroe Islands must have been older than the lawbook of 1274. It must have been found expedient to convene the Lawthing in the same week as the Guild. The divine service every morning must originally have been part of the Guild's proceedings.",

    "abstract": "The editions of F\u00e6reyinga saga are all based on Flateyarb\u00f3k. In the first chapter of the saga in that manuscript it is stated that Gr\u00edmr kamban was the first man to settle in the Faroes, and that he settled there in the days of King Haraldr h\u00e1rfagri; but from genealogies, in Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k and elsewhere, it is clear that Gr\u00edmr kamban lived long before the days of King Haraldr. Scholars have thus agreed that the dating of this first settlement in F\u00e6reyinga saga is wrong. Finnur J\u00f3nsson thought it doubtful that the first chapter of F\u00e6reyinga saga was original (c/.F\u00e6reyingasaga, Copenhagen 1927, p. ix), but from the relationship of the text to Laxd\u00e6la saga we may conclude that this first chapter is at least as old as the original version of the saga. The sentence referring to Gr\u00edmr kamban and his settlement in the Faroes is in Flateyarb\u00f3k taken from a manuscript of \u00d3lafs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta; from the text of AM 62 fol., a sister manuscript to Flateyarb\u00f3k, it can be seen that the text of their common original was corrupt, and this has been corrected by the scribe of Flateyarb\u00f3k to read: 'hann (i. e. Gr\u00edmr kamban) bygde fystr F\u00e6reyiar a dpgum Haralldz h\u00edns harfagra. ba flydu' etc. AM 61 fol., however, and other manuscripts which agree with it at this point, clearly preserve the text of F\u00e6reyinga saga intact: 'Sva er sagt at Grimr kamban byg\u00f0i fyrstr manna F\u00e6reyiar. En a dpgum Haralldz ens harfagra fly\u00f0u fyrir hans Riki fipl\u00f0i manna.'\r\nThe settlement of Gr\u00edmr kamban was thus not in fact assigned to a definite date in F\u00e6reyinga saga, and the author probably knew of this settlement from oral tradition.",

    "abstract": "The present paper deals with the results of an archaeological investigati &amp;gt;n, made in 1956, of a settlement in a place called i Eingjartoftum, Sandav\u00e1gur (V\u00e1gar), situated high in the cultivated area (fig. 1). In 1917, close by, was found a runic stone with the inscription: bork\u00e6l onondarsun austmabr of ruhalande bygbe bena s(t)ab fyst, by Br\u00f8ndumsNielsen3 dated to about 1200, and besides, from t\u00edme to time small Hnds have been made hereabout (fig. 2).\r\nFig. 3 shows sections of the place where according to the finder's account in 1956 the runic stone was situated, and of the sites above. The latter turned out to consist of 2 rooms, or rather houses (tig. 4), as there can be no doubt that the methods of construction employed were quite different, so in their origin they cannot be of the same age although after the construction of house I they were used simultanes ously. House I (fig. 5) is 6 m in length, 3 m across, oriented NE\u2014SW, with 1 \u2014 1,5 m thick walls of rough stones and stone slabs placed edgeways (fig. 6, right), with rubble mainly consisting of pebbles. House II (fig. 7),6,5 m in length, 2,35 m across, oriented NW\u2014SE, perpendicular to the other, has 0,75\u20141,5 m thick walls of piled boulders, with rubble of earth and pebbles. Above the eastern longitudinal wall of house I is running a passage nicely paved with stone slabs, to the east limited by a stone wall built up against a moraine hill situated on a glaciated rock. Owing to the rather considerable difference of height between the passage and the floor (the latter partly paved with stone clabs, too) in house I, a flight of steps has been made inside the entrance of the eastern longitudinal wall, fig. 6.\r\nImmediately north of the steps there had been a fireplace, of which only the bottom was left In house II there had been a fireplace by the northern wall, no doubt the original one, and another by the noithern part of the south wall, probably dating from a later use of the house, as it seemed to be placed on the earlier floor deposits (fig. 8).\r\nThe houses have been pulled down, and the stone materials of the walls filled in between the foundation stones of the walls, nearly the only ones preserved. Glazed fragments of earthen vessels among the stones seem to indicate that this took place in the 16th century16 (list of finds, house I, 3, 6).\r\nBoth the method of building and t\u00ednds of earthen vessels of Viking Age type (list of finds, house II, 11, 17, 18)5 in house II seem to show that this one is the oldest, probably early Middle Ages, and that house I must have been added in a later period.10 The method of building, which in these islands, till now, is only known from 13th and 14th centuries, and the complete absence in this house of earthen vessels or&amp;nbsp;other finds which can be older than 13th century, more likely from 14th or 15th century, may prove this (house I, 7 and II, 8, 9, 10, 13).l l On the other hand, finds of the same type in both houses are showing that they were inhabited simultaneously in later period. There can be no doubt about the fact that types of houses and finds are mediaeval, and at any rate there is nothing speaking against the assumption that this is the settlement of bork\u00e6l onondarsun, or ratherpart of it, and that he placed the runic stone close to his house as a documentation that he was the first person who in the Middle Ages built, if not the village of Sandav\u00e1gur, at any rate just this place.",

    "abstract": "The article is about &quot;\u00f3\u00f0alsr\u00e6ttur&quot; (allodial right), i. e. the right of the family to landed property, especially the right of redeeming such property if it has fallen into the hands of strangers. A survey is given of the development of this right in the Faroes, on the background of the development in the other Scandinavian countries.\r\nBy way of introduction, in section I is shown the etymological accordance between the words &quot;\u00e6tt&quot; (family), &quot;eiga&quot; (possess), and &quot;\u00f3\u00f0al&quot; (allodium), dating back to a period when landed property was owned by the family, according to the earliest primitive conception even by the deceased members of the family, interred in the grave-mound near the farm.\r\nIn section II is mentioned the right of the family according to the&amp;nbsp;Scandinavian provincial laws. Some Swedish laws contain prohibitions of sale ot landed property outside the family, apart from extreme cases; but the more recent Danish and Swedish laws \u2014 in the case of sale of landed property \u2014 only contain rules of the property being compulsorily offered to the members of the family, and of the latter being entitled to redeem the property if it is being sold. Similar rules as to the so-called &quot;\u00f3\u00f0alsj\u00f8r\u00f0&quot; (allodials), i. e. landed property which has belonged to the same family through many generations (4-6), are to befound in the Norwegian provincial laws. Those entitled to landed property of this kind had a higher social standing than other farmers.\r\nIn section III is mentioned the development in the Faroes from the landnam to 1789. While in Iceland \u201e\u00f3\u00f0alsr\u00e6ttur&quot; was probably not introduced until 1622, the right is mentioned in the Shetlandic records 1604, and in the Faroes it must have been introduced \u2014 if not earlier \u2014 when the Norwegian Gulatings-law was put in force in the islands in 1273. This law was replaced by the Norwegian National Law of 1274, which was presumably put in force in the Faroes between 1276 and 1280. The rules of the national law as to &quot;\u00f3\u00f0alsr\u00e6ttur&quot; were replaced by King Christian IV's Norwegian Law of 1604 In the oldest Faroese records preserved (1615\u201454) several allodial lawsuits are mentioned.\r\nNew rules as to &quot;\u00f3\u00f0alsr\u00e6ttur&quot; were put in force in 1688 with King Christian V's Norwegian Law. These rules were partly&amp;nbsp; changed through a Norwegian Statute of Jan. 14, 1771, which was put in force in the Faroes in 1789. In section IV is mentioned the development outside the Faroes. In Sweden the right of the family of redeeming landed property was repealed about 1860. In Denmark it was not repealed formally until 1927, but in practice \u2014 apart from the island of Bornholm \u2014 it had been repealed before 1800. In Norway different attacks were made on &quot;\u00f3\u00f0alsr\u00e6ttur&quot; in the latter half of the 18th century, after which the right was somewhat limited through the Statute of 1771 mentioned above, and in reality practically repealed through a Statute of April 5, 1811. As a reaction to this development a provision was inserted in the Norwegian Constitution of May 17, 1814, that &quot;\u00f3\u00f0alsr\u00e6ttur&quot; must not be repealed.&amp;nbsp;\r\nThe Norwegian rules as to this right are now to be found in Statute of June 26, 1821. as subsequently amended. In section V is mentioned the development in the Faroes 1789\u20141857. The Norwegian Statute of April 5, 1811, was not put in force in the Faroes, but similar rules were introduced through a Faroese Statute of Jan. 14, 1829, and by Statute of March 4, 1857, the right was completely repealed. Later on, however, wishes have occasionally been expressed to have the right reintroduced in some modern form. The question was for instance the subject of discussion in the Lagting in 1943.",

    "abstract": "A definition of the notion o\u00a3 life span is given, and reflexions on factors of importance rising the life span in a socity. It is emphasized that the single man in spite of all protecting measures is able to live only a limited span of years. Degenerative processes will lead to old age and death of the individual. The maximum life time beyond which human life does not exist will hardly exceed 115 years. There is no reason to believe that this maximum life time has varied within historical time.\r\nStatements of men who have attained to an even higher must be taken with some reservation. In earlier centuries the registration of birth was not trustworthy, and the memory of the individual often failed. It has not been proved that \u00bbGele-Royal\u00ab and \u00bbH-3 (procainhydrochloride) \u00ab lengthen life-time of man. In Western Europe the individual lives in such protecting surroundings that the conditions are present for attaining the maximum life-time. When some people are trying to find an elexir o\u00a3 life I think it is because man whishes to live an eternal life on earth and not forgetting it is good business to make such an elexir.\r\nIf you accept a restricted life time, the man of science must confine himself to look for the causes of inevitable degenerative processes in organs with advancing ages and to prevent profylactically these processes from injuring the individual too early. Different hypotheses are set up and scientists are occupied with these problems because the diseases in question (arteriosclerosis of the coronaries) are nowadays increasing especially among young men in all the western world. Scientistshave tried to find connection with habits of smoking, eating, and exaggerated intake of alcohol, which are nearly connected with livingstandard.\r\nThe forced mode of life in the western world, which enormously stress the individual, have also been in the searchlight. Then the author briefly describes the pathologic-anatomical transformations in arteriosclerosis, especially affecting the coronaries.The observations of Keys10.11 are described in details, especially his observations made on Japanese living in Japan, Hawaii, and California.\r\nThe Japanese living in California consume more food rich in animal fats than Japanese living in Hawaii ( 4 0% against 20\u00b0/o). In Japan the inhabitants have a diminutive intake of animal fats. The fat in the food is due to plant oils (10\u00b0/o of the calorie-intake). The most important difference between animal-fats and plant-oil are the contents of saturated fatty acids in the former and unsaturated ones in the latter. It is emphasized that fish, products of fish, meat, and whale-blubber containunsaturated fatty acids. The level of serumcholesterol is of importance in arteriosclerosis. Prominent investigators have demonstrated that unsaturated fatty acids make a fall in the level of serumcholesterol and it is possible that intake of unsaturated fatty acids protects against arteriosclerosis, but it has not yet been proved.\r\nln Faroe Islands the population have other habits of eating than in other western countries, and arteriosclerosis in the coronaries are seldom among the inhabitants. Therefore the author has examined the level of serumcholesterol in a small part of the population. 200 analysis have been performed. The results are presented tabularly. The level of serumcholesterol is about 40\u201450 mg \u00b0/o lower than in a corresponding part of the Danish population. But you cannot draw general reflexions because of the small number of people. But it is of great importance to investigate the question thoroughly, for which reasonthe author has projected a larger investigation. These investigations are of interest as well to the scientists as to the Faroe Islands, as Faroe Islands are self-sufficient as to fish, products of fish, meat of pilot whales and whale-blubber. The question is therefore of interest from a social point of view. It is high time to do it, before old habits of eating in Faroe Islands are fading away.",

    "abstract": "In the old Faroese village, heimrustir are the areas round the houses of the village, which are used for building, grazing, and for digging turf and clay for house-building. In the southern islands these areas are called skattagrundir or rustari. Etymologically, heimrustir means the areas cleared of stones near the houses of the village, while skattagrundir means the plots on which taxes are paid.\r\nSometimes these areas are also called almenningur; but, in fact, this is only the part of the cultivated area used for traffic for people (public roads) or animals (Faroese: geilir), or for other public purposes. The historical trend has been towards the fact that while almenningur remained communal property, the division into village districts in the Middle Ages brought about the fact that each district got its separate heimrustir, which formed the basis of the assessment of the King's tax (land tax assessment), and to which, perhaps, the number of merkur (m\u00f8rk: Faroese unit of land valuation based on estimatedcapability of feeding a certain number of sheep) was attached. Thus, a considerable resemblance seems to have been between heimrustir and the paddocks in the Danish and Swedish communal ownerships of land.\r\nThe \u00bbpulverizing\u00ab of the freeholJs through distributions brought about the fact that the individual owner got landed property, and in that way a share in heimrustir in different districts of the village, which in many places \u2014 especially in the northern islands brought about the opinion that heimrustir were communal property for all the village.\r\nIn other places this development brought about the state of things that the King's yeomen, who paid the King's tax for a district, considered themselves as solely entitled to the heimrustir or skattagrundir belonging to the district.\r\nNowadays it is like this: in many places especially in the northern islands \u2014 heimrustir are considered as belonging to the number of merkur of all the village, while in other places \u2014 especially in the southern islands \u2014 they are considered as adjoining land to particular landed properties.\r\nAnyone who has a share in heimrustir, is entitled to use them for building, grazing, etc. when not infringing the well-earned rights of others of using the piece in question of the heimrust. It must be regarded as certain that one may gain a prescriptive right to heimrustir, while proprietary rights are out of the question for the participants in the communal property.\r\nTransfer of ownership to separate pieces of heimrustir may take place with the consent of all the participants in the piece in question, or by abandoning the collective system. Through the exchange of strip holdings for separate compact holdings, the heimrustir are disappearing, the shares of the individual owners, together with their scattered fields, being included in the new title numbers.",

    "abstract": "The present work is a continuation of an article in Fr\u00f3iskaparrit VIII, 1959, and deals with the new cases of tubercular disease in joints and bones, subcutaneous glands, genital organs and bladder, skin and lungs, occurring in the Medical District of Ei\u00f0i from 27. VI. 1920 to 26. VI. 1952. In addition reference is made to cases with fatal results and to nonstubercular diseases which often appear simultaneously with initial fever and are apparently due to toxins from the tubercular bacillus.\r\nIn the case of 14 children and adults (9 male, 5 female) tuberculosis occurred in Iimbs and bones. 3 of these became ill twice, the second ime the tuberculosis was in an entirely different bone. The total number of cases was thus 17 (11 m., 6 f.). Table 1 shows that these fall naturally into 2 groups: children under 15 years, in all 6 cases (4 children), and adults between 20 and 39 years, 10 cases involving 9 persons (8 m., 1 f.). Further the case of a woman over 60. There was no case between 15 and 19 years. This position is reversed in cases of initial fever, noted at the bottom of Table 1. It occurred more frequently during these years than at any other time.\r\nThere are two cases of tuberculosis of the joints: 1 child and 1 adult. In the case of the child spondylitis occurred 2 years 5 months after tuberculosis of the knee joint. This case is therefore given on Table 2 (No. 3), which deals with the cases of spondylitis, 8 in all, further the tubercular diseases which proceded and followed behind.\r\nIn 4 out of the 8 cases spondylitis arose within two years after the date of infection. The period was longer in the other cases, in the case of No. 9 at least 20 years. 1 of the 8 patients with spondylitis had only a single tubercular vertebra, all the others had two. In 6 cases the lumber vertebrae were affected and these only were tubercular.\r\nAltogether 3 of the patients with bone tuberculosis died, 1 of pulmonary tuberculosis. Table 3 consists of a list of those bones and joints where the tuberculosis was situated.&amp;nbsp;\r\nAltogether 19 (9 m., 10 f.) children and adults with tuberculosis of the subcutaneous glands. Their sex and age are given in Table 4. 14 had glandular swellings on the neck, in 4 cases swellings were in the elbow and armpits, and 1 case was diagnosed as adenitis subcutanea tuberculosa universal. It will be seen from Table 5 that 5 of the 15, all children aged 10 years or less and 2 others aged 15 and 21 years, developed their tubercular swellings within 2 years of infection. 6 showed an interval of 5 to 18 years from infection to illness, 1 took at least 9 years, another not less than 12 years between infection and illness, in 4 cases no details are available. In 3 of the 19 cases growth of the subcutaneous glands and the incidence of tubercular disease in the lungs and pleura occurred to some extent simultaneously.\r\nIn the case of 5 men and 1 woman the tuberculosis was situated in the genital organs. 4 of the 5 men had tuberculosis on both sides, only 1 case, the oldest of all, was on one side only. In none of the cases did both glands become affected at the same time, the interval being from 6 months to 2 years. The date of infection is not known in the case of the two oldest patients, aged 57 and 38; infection in the other 3 cases took place 4 years, 6 months and 4 months respect ively before illness. The last 2 also had tuberculosis in other organs&amp;nbsp;as well. \u2014 The female patient died at the age of 20 of tub. peritoneie salpingitide. She was presumably infected by her mother in her earliest childhood.\r\n5 cases of skin tuberculosis: 3 children, 10 to 14 years, with tuberculs ides, a man of 24 years with a well defined tubercular lump at the top of the outer side of the left thigh, and a woman of 55 years with lupus vulgaris. In the first 4 cases the tubercular disease appeared respectively 1 year, 6 years, 3 months and at least 5 years from the time of infection. No details are available for the 5th case.&amp;nbsp;\r\nBy pulmonary tuberculosis we here mean changes in the lungs which show themselves to be tubercular as a result of auscultation, percussion or occurrence of tubercular bacilli in smears. It will be seen from Table 6 that altogether 76 (38 m., 38 f.) new cases were noted in the period of 32 years, and that tubercular bacilli were found in the sputum of 64 of these (33 m., 31 f.). As Table 7 shows altogether 31 persons (12 m., 19 f.) died. In 25 of the 76 new cases the date of infection is known, see Table 8. No less than 18 (10 + 8), 72\u00b0/o of these 25, became ill in the 10 years from their 15th birthday to the end of the 24th year. The period between infection and the appearance of tuberculosis is seen from the table to be extremely variable, but all the indications suggest that these 10 years are particularly dangerous for those infected at such an age or earlier. In Table 9, graphs illustrate (I) cases of initial fever (106), (II) new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis (76), (III) deaths from this cause (37, see below). The initial fever begins 10 years before pulmonary tuberculosis, and this 5 years before the deaths' graph.\r\nGraph I rises steeply and stops in the forties; graphs II and III continue to the eighties. During the period of 32 years there occurred 31 deaths of pulmonary tuberculosis among the 76 new cases noted in the Medical District of Ei\u00f0i. If all the deaths which occurred in this period are to be included, we must add those cases where the disease began and was known before 27. VI. 1920 and who died after this day. These numbered 6 (3 m., 3 f.), giving a grand total of 37. As Table 11 shows, all told47 deaths occurred from all forms of tuberculosis, which equals 6,6 per 10,000 for the whole medical district and 5,2 per 10,000 from pulmonary tuberculosis in the 32 years.\r\nTuberculosis is by no means equally distributed. In village M with 231 inhabitants there were 19 deaths from all forms of tuberculosis, of which 16 were pulmonary tuberculosis, which equals 25,8 and 21,6 deaths per 10,000 respectively. In village B with 247 inhabitants the corresponding numbers were 13,9 and 11,4. The parish with the highest population (629) and 8 and 6 deaths equals 4 and 3. Another parish&amp;nbsp;with 436 inhabitants had only 1 death (menigitis) in these 32 years.\r\nErythema nodosum is not the only nonstubercular disease which is opserved together with or immediately after the initial fever. 5 others are here named angina, enlargement of the spieen, glomerulonephritis, phlebitis, myalgia and together with these arthroitis. These must be occasioned by the toxins of the tubercular bacillus. Not a few sufferers with initial fever have reddening in the throat. In 3 cases, all children, aged 4 months, 6 months and 7 years, the spleen was felt to be enlarged. 1 girl aged 17 had h\u00e6morrh. nephritis; she died 6 months later of tub. pulm. A 19\u00bbyear old girl and a 26*year old man passed through severe tubercular infections, lljl months after the onset of initial fever they were subject to serious phlebitis. The first died 5 months later of tub. pulm. caseosa, the other had to suffer a considerable number of tubercular diseases, including tub. pulm. ( + t b . ) , and spent over 3 years in sanatoria and hospitals before being certifitd as cured. An 185year old girl was afflicted with severe myalgia and arthritis; she died of tub. pulm. miliaris 4 months after the onset of initial fever.&amp;nbsp;",

    "abstract": "In ancient times the geographical name F\u00f8royar (pronounced: f\u00f8rjar forms with \u00f8 first from 15C) was always written F\u00e6rey(j)ar. In a document from c. 1200, the soscalled \u00bbHistoria Norwegi\u00e6\u00ab (first printed 1850 from a 15C Orkney ms.) the name is translated \u00bbInsulae Ovium\u00ab. The same interpretation is found \u2014 independently \u2014 in the works of the Icelanders Arngr\u00edmur J\u00f3nsson (1593, 1609) and Th. Torf\u00e6us (1695). On the other hand the Norwegian Abs. Peders\u00f8n Beyer (1569) who had heard of this interpretation \u2014 from where is unknown \u2014 expresses some doubt as to its correctness, while Peder Clauss\u00f8n Friis (c. 1600), Th. Tarnovius (1669) and Lucas Debes (1673) reject it outright. At that time a word corresponding to Danish and Swedish fir 'sheep' was unknown in West Norse, it having been replaced by sau6(u)r (norw. sau(d), far. sey\u00f0ur). But the corresponding West Norse word f\u00e6r (vowel change \u00e1 to \u00e6 by R\u00bbumlaut) was known as a simplex in 12C Iceland since it occurs in the first grammatical treatise (in one ms. of the \u00bbSnorra&amp;nbsp;Edda\u00ab) and as a compound in f\u00e6rsau\u00ed\u00edr 'sheep' in Norw.\u00abIcel. legal language and in biblical texts. In addition we have the names of certain islets: Norw. F\u00e6roy, Orkney Faray or Fara, Hebridean Fiaray, which all seem to mean 'Sheep Island', cf. the common Hebridean island name Soay, an original Saufcey (cf. Icel. Saubeyar), having the same meaning.\r\nFinally Icel f\u00e6rilus and Far. f\u00f8rilus (change from \u00e6 to \u00f8 as in F\u00f8royar from F\u00e6rey(j)ar 'sheepstick' presuppose a neuter ia=stem f\u00e6ri as a de\u00ab rivative of f\u00e6r.\r\nDebes considered it inconceivable that sheep were present in the Faroes when these were discovered by the Norsemen. To this Torf\u00e6us rejoins: \u00bbpoterant autem ovibus abundare antequam Norvegi eas ins venerunt, impositis forte a piratis, qui illuc receptum habuerunt, ad se, quoties eas transirent, recentibus carnibus recreandos, qu\u00e6 in magnum numerum e paucis subit\u00f3 poterant excrescere\u00ab. Proof that there were many sheep in the Faroes about 800 was forthcoming in 1807 on the publication of \u00bbDicuili Liber De Mensura Orbis Terrae\u00ab (from 825) and Letronne's demonstration in 1814 that the group of islands mentioned in the work and where Irish monks had been settled for a hundred years must be identified as the Faroes. Dicuil says that now(825) these islands were \u00bbcausa latronum Nor(t)mannorum vacu\u00e6 anas choritis, plenae innumerabilibus ovibus\u00ab-. Hence historically as well as linguistically the interpretation of F\u00e6rey(j)ar as 'Sheep Islands' is so appopriate that the suggestion of a presNorse element in the name (Br\u00f8gger 1930) \u2014 as in Orkneyjar and possibly Hjaltland (Shetland) \u2014 seems uncalled for.",

    "abstract": "The present work collects the fresh cases of initial fever, meningitis tub., tub. universalis, tub. miliaris peritonei, pericarditis caseosa prosductiva tub. and pleuritis exs. tub. in the medical district of Ei\u00f0i, Faroes, in the period from 27/6 1920 to 26/6 1952.By initial fever is here understood the febrile condition which often, but not always, sets in in connection with tuberculosis infection, and almost simultaneously with the conversion of the organism from anergy to allergy. It appears from Table 1 that, in all, in that period were known 106 cases of initial fever: cf 57, 2 49.\r\nWhen the conversion takes place, it sometimes happens that the newly infected person does not feel it at all. Such quite nonsfebrile conditions are not included here. For that purpose a certain temperas ture is required \u2014 short or long, low or high.Table 1 includes 47 children and 59 adults. As to the former, the infection sources are known: 20 were infected in their homes, and 23 in neighbouring houses \u2014 most of the latter by people whose tuberculosis had not yet been discovered. 4 children were infected while staying in other villages.\r\nOf the adults, 13 were infected in their homes, and just as many in the neighbourhood or the circle of friends. In all these cases the infection sources are known. The others were infected during their work in other villages or towns, and in fishing vessels. In these cases the infection sources are not always known.\r\nA man of 21 vvas infected with tuberculosis through a wound in his left f\u00f3refinger. Lymfangitis supervened, abscesses on the inside of the supper arm and in armpits. A girl of 8 was infected through her tonsils. The infection was followed by a glandular tumour on the neck.\r\nMany of the newly infected complained of retrosternal pain in connection with swallowings, to both sides of the sternum, or pain round one or several of the thoracic vertebrae. Others talked of stitches, which were localized to different places of the chest.&amp;nbsp;\r\nIn some cases the fever lasted for one day only or so, in others for rather a long time. Thus a 6 years old boy had initial fever for 7 months. X=ray examination at the beginning of the disease and 3 months later showed an increased shadow in the right hilus, otherwise nothing abnormal. 1 month after this were found a perihilar infiltration round the right hilus and a 3 cm broad paratracheal shadow up towards the clavicula. When further 3 months had passed, the infiltration had decreased, and only an enlarged right hilus was to be seen. Febrile and subfebrile all the time. \u2014 The duration of the initial fever seems generally to be 2\u20146 weeks.\r\nIn some cases the thermometer may show a subfebrile condition, in others a temperature of 40\u00b0 C, and in one case 41\u00b0 C as shown in Fig. 1. Adults and adolescents have a slow pulse during about the first half of the febrile period, which is also to be seen in Fig. 1. As will appear from Table 1, 27, or 25\u00b0/o, of the 106 cases with initial fever had erytema nodosum. Only 4, or 7\u00b0/o, of these were males, all of them under 15. 23, or 47\u00b0/o, were of females.&amp;nbsp;\r\nWhen the in\u00edtial fever sets in, rather often a mild and brief tonsillitis is to be seen. Occasionally there may be a brief hoarseness and a little hacking cough, which may be dry or attended by a sparse sputum. On rare occasions larger quantities are coughed up \u2014 up to 40 cra3 a day.\r\nSometimes stray wheezy sounds or rales are heard, fine crepitation or friction sounds over a more or less wide area. The initial fever may be initiated with diarrhea, 2 boys, both under 1, had an enlarged spleen. A boy of 6 had a stiffness of the neck and Kernig's Symptom&amp;nbsp;without mening\u00edtis.\r\n4 cases of meningitis tubercul. are known. In 2 of these, c? 9 years and 9 19 years, initial fever and meningitis passed gradually into each other and led to death 4\u20145 weeks after the first day of the disease. A boy of 1 died of tub. miliaris, and a man of 42 was for some time ill with tub. miliaris peritonei.\r\nThere were 106 cases of initial fever. Of these, 20\u00b0/o got pleuritis exs. tub., the children's percentage was 17, that of the adults, 22 (Table 2). Pleurisy cases in all: 73 (Table 3) - 59\u00b0/o right.sided, 41 \u00b0/o leffcsided. In Table 4, initial fever and pleurisy are compared. The former culminates at the ages of 15\u201419, the latter has its greatest incis dence between the ages of 20 and 29.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of the present paper mentions that a close study of Gaelic loanwords in Faroese (and the closely related languages as well) will lead to results which conveniently may be explained thus: From the Scots Gaelic areas through Orkney, Shetland, and the Faroes to Iceland we may draw a line from which another line may be drawn to some place on the western coast of Norway. The former line (south/north) is clear enough, though in rare cases \u00edt is impossible to decide whether i( starts from Ireland or perhaps from Western England (where e. g. a component in place\u00bbnames corresponding to Far. \u00e6rgi 'shieling' is to be found quite frequently). A picture of the same kind emerges from a thorough study of a number of seemingly Scandinavian words, e. g. gj\u00f3 (Icel. gj\u00e1, Scots geo) and stakkr (Scots stack): Both words are known and used from the Isle of Man to Northern Iceland. The archeologists have shown us that the relations of the Faroes with the Hebrides and Northern Scotland are closer than with Norway. A study of the old peasant culture of the Faroes points to a close connection in the Viking Age with settlements in the Gaelic speaking areas, this is e. g. shown in the use of tormentil roots as tanning material.\nThe present paper demonstrates the already mentioned connections as regards the use of edible algae. The names of two algae point towards Shetland and Orkney, but also towards the Gaelic speaking countries: Far. slavak vlcel. slafak) and Far. mirkjalli (Icel. mari(n)kjarni, murukjarni, myrikjarni). During the viking period the Gaelic noun slabhac was introduced into the Atlantic branches of Norse in the form slafak, and the origin of mirkjalli is no doubt to be found in the same areas. However, it is a very complicated task to explain the relations between the differing Norse forms and the not less differing Gaelic forms (in the Scotch and Irish branches). The origin of *myr(i)kjalli, the probable form of the Viking Age (from which Far. mirkjalli, and Orc, Shetl. mirkyals), seems to be a Gaelic form, lurking behind the forms given by Macalpine (1832): muirichlinn and muirlinn, i. e. forms with an \u20141\u2014 in the second component. Besides myr(i)kjalli (Far. Orc, Shetl.) a form *myr(i)kjann\u00ed seems to have ex\u00edsted, preserved in the Faroese placesname Mirkjanoyri and in Gael. mircean (Lewis). The word *myr(i)A:/ann\u00ed, proposed here, is probably the origin of the Icelandic forms mentioned above The first component has been changed in different ways due to the influence of words snch as marr 'sea' Mar\u00eda, mura 'silversweed' etc, vvhile the second component has been influenced by kjarni 'seed, core'.",

    "abstract": "In the summer of 1958, in a place called o-heima \u00e1 Oyrin/, Fuglafj\u00f8r\u00f0ur (Eysturoy), on the shore in the bottom of the fiord (fig. 1), was excavated the remains of an ancient settling beJow various strata of later buildings (figs. 5 and 6).\r\nOf the sites in the lowest stratum (houses VIII and VII), which are in reality the same house representing a long period of building, 10 m of the long side (inside measurement) are left. The house, oriented N\u2014S, is built of curved filling walls, 1.25\u20141.5 m thick, with straight cut ends, a fireplace in the middle of the floor in the longitudinal axis of the house, earthen benches along the inside of the walls, and a roof supported by posts (figs. 2 and 3). The proportionals between the breadth in the middle, 5.35 m, at the end wall, 3 m, the estimated original length, 16\u201417 m, and similar measurements in house in Trelleborg11 and Kv\u00edv\u00edk3 correspond intimately.\r\nAlthough this type of house, the Hall, is regarded as the Scandinavian house of the viking period7, and there are now 2 almost identical specimens in the Faroes3, it is not expedient, without further proof, to make use of the type as a basis for dating, the more so because in this house we have proofs fairly positive that the same building was used permanently for rather a long period, which even the difference in level of about 0.3\u20140.4 m between the floor and fire5 places seems to show. In the floor level of house VII there is a longfire, 3.5 m in length, 0.5-0.9 m across (fig. 3 and fig. 4; No. 2), below it a fireplace, 2.2 m long, 0.75 m across (fig. 4; No. 3), above a longfire, 4.75 m in length, 0.65\u20140.75 m across, with an ash*pit in the middle, belonging to house VIII (fig. 2 and fig. 4, No. 4).&amp;nbsp;\r\nAs an addition and parallel to the west wall there is a room, 5.5 m long, with a broad fireplace, 2.25 m long, 0.75 m across, and apitched floor, which owing to special circumstances has been only partly examined (house VI). The archaeological finds are so common and their condition of preservation so poor that they are difficult to date exactly. AIl the same vessels of soapstone8 with perpendicular sides (house VII, 9) and tools with Latin crosses cut in (house VII, 8) seem to speak for a dating to somewhere in the Middle Ages. The circumstances of finding contradict rather distinctly a later dating.\r\nOf finds in house VIII pointing towards an earlier dating the following are to be pointed out: Bowlsshaped vessels of soapstone, of these 1 or 2 similar finds in e. g.

Although the ribbon motifs were used for a very long time, partly in this country too, the circumstances of finding and composition of finds compel to an early dating, most likely the beginning of the Middle Ages.\r\nThe ribbon motifs, in all probability originally CelticsNorseV2.16.17 together with the characteristic type of house,7,11,13 ndicate contact with the British Isles, or direct settling from there, a circumstance to which the results of the linguistic studies of Chr. Matras9 and the brooch with ribbon ornament from Tj\u00f8rnuv\u00edk5 bear witness. On the whole, this investigation is a valuable supplement to the results at Kv\u00edv\u00edk3.&amp;nbsp;",

    "abstract": "During the period 1952\u20141958 fresh and salted middlessized Atlantos Scandian herring caught north of the Faroe Islands (64\u00b0\u201468\u00b0 N., 4\u00b0\u2014 12\u00b0 V.) has been examined for content of fat.\r\n4. table shows that the lowest content of fat (7,9 per cent) of fresh herring was found in the month of may. In the course of june and july the fat content increased rapidly reaching its highest level (19,5 per cent) about the lst of august. The decline sets in about lst of november.\r\nThe graphic representation is made on basis of the figures in 4. table including some figures from norwegian investigations of middlesized herring. Fresh herring was examined with head and intestines.\r\nThe fat content of salted herring was slightly above 20 per cent from the end of july till the end of september, falling to 19,9 per cent in oktober and to 18,8 per cent at ihe beginning of november. Salted herring was examined beheaded and without stomach. Due to this fact&amp;nbsp;and the shrinkage by salting the fat content of salted herring is slightly higher than that of fre^h herring.\r\n7. table shows the size of the herring during the per\u00edod 1953\u20141957. It appears that the quantity of big herring (minimum weight: 255 g pr. salted herring) has decreased from 95 per cent of the total production in 1953 to 47,6 per cent in 1957. At the same time the quantity of middle=sized and small herring increased considerably.\r\nA few samples of fjordherring has been examined. The result shown in 8. table seems to demonstrate that the content of fat of fjordherring has a similar seasonal variation as in Atlanto=Scandian herring. Difference of fat content of big and small herring is so considerable at the same season (samples no. 13 and no. 14) that future investigation will have to divide the material into different size^groups examining each group separately.",

The measurements were made partly at the point of impact of the power station, in the levels 300 and 400 north of Vestmanna, partly at the power station itself. The measurements show that the precipitation is about 50 per cent bigger in level 400 than in level 5, corresponding to an addition in height of 0.125 per cent per metre.Moreover, the measurements show that the precipitation registered by the used pluviometers is about 15 per cent too little, and that a shifting in the flow-off is taking place from spring to autumn, probably on account of vertical minor joints and the porous intrabasaltic material.",

The data are obtained from examination in London of Whaling Statistics on a wider scale than available in T\u00f3rshavn, correlation of the foetal weights of Pilot whales obtained in F\u00f8royar with the foetal statistics of the other toothed species, the Sperm whale, derived partly from Matthews (1938), Clarhe (1956) and unpublished data.\r\nThe most important conclusions concern the period of gestation in&amp;nbsp;different species. It would appear probable that baleen whales, are as suggested less than 1 year, probably 10 months T 1 month and of these it appears probable that the Blue whale is 9\u201410 months but the foetus at full term is only 1\u20142 tons, rarely, though occasionally, 3\u20144 tons. Secondly the Odontocoeti (Sperm and Pilot) differ from the Mystacoeti (Baleen whales) in being over 1 year. Our Pilot whale foetuses at or about August lst were of 2 age groups, about 700-800 gram and about 50,000 gram, strongly suggesting gestation periods over 1 year, about 14 or 15 months. Both Matthews and Clarke suggest 15\u201416 months as the gestation period for Sperm whales. These are shown in the appended figure.&amp;nbsp;",

All children under 15, 727 in all (353\u0111\\ 374 9 ) , were examined in the 6 years from 1945 to 1950. In 1945 the author of this article had for 25 years been the panel doctor of the abovesmentioned district, the children of which constitute the material for this work. Consequently case books of nearly all the children were kept. The results of the examinations were coms pared with the information of the case books about former diseases. What is&amp;nbsp;stated below is therefore a great many things about the health of the children from the cradle to the day of examination.\r\n32 children, 4\u00b0/o, had a positive tuberculin test. 16 of these had passed through initial fever or others of the tuberculous diseases usually setting in shortly after infection; the other 16 had had no symptoms. All the children were well at the time of examination.\u20142 girls had organic heart disease, one\u2014perhaps both of them\u2014born with it. 2 other girls had asthma. 1 boy Laurence* Mooti&amp;lt; Biedl's Disease. N o child under 1 had caries; but of those 1 to 4 years old, 35\u00b0/o, of those 5 to 9 years old, 83\u00b0/o, and of those 10 to 14 years old, 90\u00b0/o. A comparison between this examination and previous ones brings about the conslusion that the teeth of the small children are now much better then formerly, those of the big ones worse: among the children of 2 to 4 years there were 72\u00b0/o with caries in 1925, in 1945-50, 43\u00b0/o, among the former much more violent then among the latter. Among the children of 7 to 14 years the percentage was 74 in 1925, now about 90. In 1920 and the following years the sea round the Faroes was almost devoid of fish, and cod liver oil, therefore, a rare article. This circumstance was probably the cause of the bad teeth of the small children in 1925.\r\n79 children out of 727 (ll\u00b0/o) had had inflammation of the middle ear (otitis media). N o child with flux during the examination. 9 children had a certain reduction of hearing in one or both ears.\u2014About 10\u00b0/o of the examined children had or had had umbilical hernia in the first months of living. Most of the hernias disappeared in time. Only 1 child of those 10 to 14 years old had umbilical hernia.\u201411 children had been operated for inguinal hernia, all of them before they had completed their 6th year. Moreover, 1 boy of seven whose hernia was discovered at the examination. 95 children, 13\u00b0/o, had Harrison's furrow. 24 of these, 26\u00b0/o, had it only on one side, and especially on the leftshand one (the ratio 20 to 4). 10 out of the 71 with Harrison's furrow on both sides had a deeper furrow on the leftshand side of the breast than on the rightshand one&amp;nbsp;(the ratio 10 to 61).\u201436 out of 727, 5\u00b0/o, had pigeon=breast, and 3 funnel chest.\r\nMost of the above\u00abmentioned deformities vvere little marked. The sternal ends of some of the ribs (most often 3rd to 6th) curved outwards on one or both sides on 33 children, 5\u00b0/o. More often row of curves on the righkhand side than on the lefkhand one. If the curves were on both sides, they were often more marked on the right-hand side than on the leftshand one.\u201413 children were bowvlegged, 6 knockskneed, 2 had dextro convex scoliosis, 28 sinistro convex scoliosis, 18 mild kyfosis, and with 23 lordosis was obliterated. Too deep lordosis was seen 5 times. Diabetes mellitus was shown in a 10 year old girl.\u20146 children from 3 different homes had had mild symptoms of pellagra; they were fit on the day of examination. 72\u00b0/o of the girls in the last 6 months before their 15th birthday had had menses. 38\u00b0/o of the boys at the same age had fully developed hirci.&amp;nbsp;",

The census shows that at the end of 1958 there were in the Faroese population (1958: 34,296 inhabitants) 179 mentally deficient in all, or 0.52 per 100 inhabitants, 94 men, and 85 women. Out of these, 44 were to be characterized as mentally deficient in the mildest degree (morons), 98 mentally deficient in the medium degree (imbeciles), and 37 mentally deficient in the most extreme degree (idiots). None of them were married. The division of the mentally deficient according to age, degree, and residence appears from the tables 1, 2, and 4, according to the underlying causes of menfal deficiency from the table 3. 68 were in homes (in Denmark) for the mentally deficient, but further 35 were in urgent need of being removed to such homes. Presumably a small number of persons (on a rough estimate about 20) have been overlooked in this census. \u2014 Therefore, the first time, a home for the mentally deficient in the Faroes ought to have accomodation for at least about 100 inmates.&amp;nbsp;",

    "abstract": "By about 1900 Dr. Jakob Jakobsen had discovered that quite a number of Celtic words, mostly Gaelic, were to be found in Shetland Norn (see Shetlands\u00f8ernes Stednavne, 1901; English edition The Place-Names of Shetland, 1936). He likewise showed that traces of this same influence may be observed in Faroese in his article \u00abKeltisk Indflydelse paa F\u00e6roerne\u00bb (see Tingakrossur, nr. 1\u20142, 1902, and Jakob Jakobsen: Greinir og Ritger\u00f0ir, T\u00f3rshavn, 1957). Here he compares Far. d r u n n u r \u00abend, tailspiece of an animal\u00bb, otherwise attested in Scandinavian only in Shetl. d r o n n , with Gael. d r o n n which has the same meaning. Now the Faroese use the d r u n n u r (of sheep or cattle) at weddings to recite impromtu verses over and Dr. Jakobsen conjectured that this custom was introduced to the Faroes from the south, though nothing was remembered about the custom in Shetland. The present article refers in detail to the Faroese custom both now and formerly and adduces the fact that in the Scots Gaelic area verses were composed over the d r o n n of sheep or cattle, according to Dwelly this was also a custom at weddings. Thus what Dr. Jakobsen advanced as a conjecture we may now regard as certainty. Finally mention is made of Icel. d r u n n u r in the meaning \u00abhind part of an animal's back\u00bb which must surely be the same word. Formally it ressembles Mlrish d r o n d (also written d r o n n ) , though it is more likely that the Icelandic form is due to analogy vith another Iceslandic word or words with \u2014 n d \u2014",

The author has been practitioner in the medical district of Ei\u00f0i from june 1920 to june 1952 at which latter year there were 2300 inhabitants in the district, and before those 32 years only one person here, a woman, has suffered from diabetes; she died of this disease in 1914, 40 years of age. The next case occured in 1931 and from 1931 to 1952 17 persons were suffering from diabetes in the medical district of Ei\u00f0i. Ten of those cases were still living in june 1952.

    "abstract": "Scots Gaelic caigeann (s. f., et v.) and Faroese k\u00f8kja (s. f., et v.) are so similar in meaning and sound that there can be no doubt that they are of common origin. Both are used to denote a means of fastening two animals together, in the Faroes two sheep, in Scotland two sheep, goats or ponies. In both places a thin board is sometimes used to fasten&amp;nbsp;the animals together. In the Faroes (Su\u00f0uroy) this board has two holes in it, in Scotland (South Uist) three holes are customary. Since the Faroese word does not occur in any other Scandinavian language we may assume that the word is originally Gaelic. In the Viking Age the resent form ca\u00edgeann was most Iikely ^coicenn (according to MacBain a compound con- \u00abwith\u00bb and cenn \u00abhead\u00bb).

Otherwise the volume of the leypur has been reckoned as a proportion of the tunna (\u00abbarrel\u00bb), the skeppa (8 skeppur = 1 f.), the kannub\u00e6ri (48 fcannub\u00e6rar = 1 f.) and th? fimtingur (16 fimtingar = 1 f.) to which so many /eypur\u00abnames bear witness. The fimtingur is only in use in Su\u00f0uroy and as a Zeypur\u00bbmeasure only in the villages of Hov and Sandv\u00edk. 2. To the question \u00abWhat is the leypur used for?\u00bb one is tempted to answer \u00abWhat is the leypur not used for?\u00bb The leypur has, indeed, followed the Faroeman in all his work on hill and shore, in the cliffs and out at sea. The leypur is borne on the back. It can also be carried by a pony; in the case a leypur hangs from each side of the animal.\r\nA man bearing a leypur uses a head band (see Figs. 3 and 4). The band is described, including the materials used, the various modes of fixing it, of tying the knot in it and of fastening it to the leypur (see Figs. 1 and 2).\r\nThe use of the leypur is described in connection with the following: peat, manure and seaweed, fish offal, corn, hay, wool, fish, whalemeat and in connection with work on the land incl. planting, in connection with fishing whether by line or net, when fowling in the cliffs, for carrying ice and snow, conveyance of goods and other articles of every sort, e. g. the belongings of priest, doctor or bailiff. But not only men, women and children have also borne the leypur. Peat and manure have in addition been carried on horseback. The chief use of the leypur will have been for peat, manure and seaweed, and fish.\r\nA small number of tools are referred to which are used in making leypar and which are called after it. In some villages carpenters made most of the leypar, but on the whole every Faroeman knew how to make himself a leypur. Even those who carry the leypur a great deal do not suffer from any special \u00aboccupational complaints\u00bb, other than that a man can get a depression across his head from the band and prominences on the back, corresponding to the spines on his back from the leypur itself, but these are not dangerous. \u2014 The body does not become bent through carrying a leypur.\r\nIt is odd that the many tales relating to the huldumenn (invisible beings of human size) never \u2014 as far as the author knows \u2014 mention the leypur, especially since superstition had it that the huldumenn worked just like ordinary mortals, they had sheep and cattle, they fished from their boats etc, but had no leypur.&amp;nbsp;",

    "abstract": "The present study sets out to evaluate critically the incidence of tuberculosis in the Faroes in the 19th and 20th centuries on the basis of the literature available, the evidence contained in death certificates (introduced in 1879) and in notifications of new cases of tuberculous&amp;nbsp;infection in lungs and larynx (in use since 1899). Concerning the information set out in the death certificates, however, we can show by reference to the special studies by Boeg (1902) and Rasmussen (1931 a) that the figure in the offical return for the period 1879-99 (Table 2) must be raised by about 10\u00b0/o, and for the period 1899 til some time into the twenties by about 33\u00b0/o. From shortly before 1930 death certis ficates appear to cover all cases of death from (with) tuberculous infection. The official notifications of new cases for the period 1899\u20141930 must be regarded as quite unreliable. But since 1930 the figures seem to be more trustworthy and, on the whole, appear to give a good picture of the incidence of tuberculosis. As a point of contrast with practice in other countries it should, however, be noted that during the past 20 years in the Faroes many of the earliest manifestations of tubcrculosis (especially initial fever) have been included in the returns; these are hardly recorded to the same extent in the tuberculosis statis stics of other countries. The official figures are set out in Table 2 and in Figures 1 and 2, but these must definitely be judged in the light of the critical remarks above.\r\nA critical examination of the present materials shows that tubercus losis was, with certainty, known in the Faroes in the 18th century, but there is nothing from which one could infer that it was not an old and familiar disease even then. Throughout the 19th century mors tality due to tuberculosis was very likely about 10\u201415 per 10,000 of the population, presumably on account of the relatively poor communications between the villages. At the close&amp;nbsp; of that century, how\u00ab ever, mortality rises rapidly, approaching a maximum of about 25 per 10,000 in the years just after 1900. Starting from the corrected number of deceased, various considerations and calculations will result in the probable number of new cases of tuberculosis in the last quarter ofthe 19th century (Table 3), so that the result can be depicted in Figure 3. By this it is shown, then, that if the statistics relating to the notification of new cases were as exact at the beginning as they are for later years, one would for the years just before the turn of the century very likely have found something like 90 cases of tuberculosis annually per 10,000 of the population. This sudden increase of the tuberculosis in the Faroes at the end of the 19th century can only be the result of the rapid development of deep sea fishing, at which men from everywhere in the islands are crowded together in confined crew accomodations (see Figure 3). Throughout the past half the 20th century tuberculosis in the Faroes has been on the decline. As for the firstquarter of the century, this decline, however, cannot presumably, to any great extent, be due to any deliberate work against the tubercus losis (already in 1908 a T. B. sanatorium was established), but is more&amp;nbsp;likely a mere consequence of the fact that infection of new classes of birth is no longer able to keep the disease on the same high level as in the end of the 19th century when the disease pervaded a partly virgin area. On the other hand, however, the steady and regular decline of the disease during the past 25\u201430 years is no doubt a result of the highly intensified work against the tuberculosis. As important factorshere one may mention the building of a chest clinic (1928), and, quite especially, a statute prescribing compulsory examination of fishermen before being allowed to sign on (1939) \u2014 by which several infectious cases have been isolated every year, and finally the introduction of B. C. G. vaccination in 1946. In the years 1946\u20141955 a totai number of 17.790 persons were vaccinated. Among these, 19 new cases of tuberculosis occurred, and 3 deaths. Among the rest of the population \u2014 a total number of 14,699 persons \u2014 355 new cases of tuberculosis occurred, and 126 deaths.&amp;nbsp;",

    "abstract": "Early in the Viking Age there was a word in Norway s o p p r m. used of \u00abfungus\u00bb. A compound of this is * m a r s o p p r \u00absea*fungus\u00bb which is unknown today except in Shetland Norn m a r s o p p and Faroese m a r s o p p u r . It is used to denote a porous or sponge4ike mass which occasionally drifts ashore. Zoologists tell us that such things are really clusters of (emty) egg capsules from the common whelk, though those who gave them a name can hardly have known that. M a r s o p p u r is now virtually extinct in Faroese, having been replaced by l \u00e6 t t i s o p p u r , also used of anything very light or of people who are uncertain in their opinions or who have none at all.\r\nThe simplex Far. s o p p u r , Shetl. s i p p [sap, (sip)] has a meaning, however, which ill accords with Norse, for it means a \u00abwisp of hay\u00bb, e.g. as is given to cattle. In medieval Norwegian and Icelandic writings s o p p r is attested on!y in the meaning of \u00abball (to play with)\u00bb; a side\u00ab form s v \u00f3 p p r has these meanings: 1. \u00absponge\u00bb (Ms. from 14th C , acc. pl. u \u00e1 t a s u o p p u ) , 2. \u00abtumour\u00bb (Ms. from 15th C, cf. A l f r \u00e6 \u00f0 i tss l a n d s III 79j, 3. \u00abball (to play with)\u00bb. In medieval Norwegian ballads s o p p has only the meaning \u00abball\u00bb, in present.day Norwegian the main meaning is \u00abfungus\u00bb with the following specialised meanings: \u00abtumour on trees, tinder (on trees)\u00bb \u00abball made of polypotus betulinus Fr.\u00bb, \u00abrhizome of nymphaea\u00bb and \u00abball of such rhizome\u00bb. In modern Icelandic down to the 19th C s o p p u r meant \u00abball\u00bb (now usually b o l t i ) , cf. the compound leiksoppur which, however, is always used in a figurative sense. The special meaning \u00abfloat (on a fishing net)\u00bb is at\u00ab tested from bingeyjars\u00fdsla. In modern Icelandic svoppr appears as sveppur and means \u00abfungus\u00bb. Thus we observe that the sense \u00abwispof hay\u00bb found in Far. and Shetl. has no parallel elsewhere in Scans dinavian, but on the other hand it is strikingly like the meaning of Gaelic sop (E. Ir. sopp). We can add that Wight, Engl. Dial. Dict...records from the English of the Isle of Man sap precisely whith the same application as in Far. and Shetl. It is possible that the Faroese expressions fara \u00e1 soppin, vera b\u00fagvin \u00e1 soppin \u2014 which refer to a woman about to give birth \u2014 are calques on Gaelic, but of this we cannot be certain until we have evidence that Irish uses sop in a similar way. At all events we may assert that the sense of Gaelic sop(p) \u00abwisp of hay\u00bb entered Faroese and Shetland Norn in the Viking Age jn the same way as such everyday words as Icel. tarfur, Far. tarvur \u2014 cf. Gael. tarbh \u00abbull\u00bb, and Orkney Norn blatho, Shetl. bleddik, Far. blak (older Far. *bla\u00f0ak) \u2014 cf. Gael. bl\u00e1thach \u00abbuttermilk\u00bb.&amp;nbsp;",

    "abstract": "The article gives an account of the Faroese leypur based upon answers to a questionnaire sent out to 39 people in 35 villages and upon the author's own observations. The present article falls into two sections. Section 1 deals with the mode of construction, Section 2 is a glossary of names given to the leypur. A concluding installment will contain two further sections, namely Section 3 on the sizes of the leypur and Section 4 on its uses. The various parts of the leypur are named (Fig. 3a), their shapes and measurements discussed and compared. Tables 1 and 2 show that these have never been hard and fast, but that they have varied accor* ding to the purpose they were designed for. It is usual for the measurements, at least in part, to vary from village to village. Fig. 3 to 8 show different sorts of leypar. Fig. 3a shows the type with 5 spars where the bottom is of similar construction as the spars. In Fig. 3 b we see the 4*spar type in which case the bottom rests upon the supporting cross pieces. Fig. 4a shovvs a 5\u00abspar type where the spars are laid across each other. The type known as rossleypur (leypur borne by horses) appears in Fig. 4b. In Fig. 5a 4\u00bbspar type is shown where the bottom rests on the supporting cross pieces. These are nailed to the posts from the inside. Fig. 5b shows the t\u00e6ttleypur (solid leypur). Fig. 6 shows the gr\u00f3tleypur (leypur for stone) with a variety of this made from solid pieces of wood in Fig. 7, and Fig. 8 a and \u00e1 show the lokaleypur (leypur with \u00e1 lid). Further types are discussed though not illustrated, e.g. a leypur with a handle for carrying in the hand, a large one designed for hay and another for carrying a fishing line in. Finely is in Fig. 8 b and d shown the fetil (a haedband for cars rying the leypur) and two different methods of fastening it. Section 2 comprises an alphabetical list of leypurmames. It may be noted that some of these names do not denote l e y p a r only but are loose descriptive epithets, eg. e g g j a k o p p u r eggsshell.",

    "abstract": "The Faroes lie in the North Atlantic. T\u00f3rshavn, the capital and virtually the geographic centre of the islands, has an annual meanrainfall of 1461 mm and 970 hours of sunshine yearly. The mean temperature in January is 3.3\u00b0 C. and in July 10.8\u00b0 C. The study covers the inhabitants above the age of 15 in a village in the medical district of Ei\u00f0i and was carried out in February 1950 by the local doctor who has served in the district for 30 years. Rheumsatism will be hardly more prevalent here than in other parts of the Faroes. The results were collected on printed forms. Three main quess tions were put to those examined: 1. Have you ever had rheumatic corrplaints? If so: 2. Have you had rheumatic complaints previously? 3. Have you rheumatic complaints at present? The complaint was then classified as either articular rheumatism with 9 subdivisions or non\u00ab articular rheumatic disorders with 7 subdivisions. The questions were followed by a medical examination.\r\nThere were all told 205 inhabitants in the village in February 1950, of whom 140 were over 15. Of these 12 were absent from home, the remaining 128 (68 males, 60 females) were involved in the investigation. 29 persons (23 \u00b0/o of the total) had never had rheumatic complaints, while 99 (77 \u00b0/o) either had or had had these complaints and 57 (45 \u00b0/o) were actually suffering from rheumatic disorders at the time of the enquiry. 26 of the 99 had or had had articular rheumatic diseases, 19 articular rheumatic diseases as well as nonsarticular rheumatism, 54 non\u00abarticular rheumatism only. The knee joint was by far commoner as the seat of the trouble than were the other joints, while in the case of nonsarticular rheumatism the shoulders and loins were the most affected parts.\r\nThe number of cases found in this investigation in the Faroes is nearly twice as large as that found in similar though much more wide\u00bb spread investigations held in England, Holland, and Denmark. Naturally one must take into some account the smallness of the area covered and also the fact that the investigator himself possessed an intimate knowledge of the persons in the village concerned, a knows ledge based on the experience of very many years service there.",

The \u00edcelandicpoet Einarr Gilsson (the 14th century) has the line: l\u00edmi geck med l\u00e1\u00e1mum \\ lundstorum gudmundi translated by Finnur J\u00f3nssonas \u00bbferlen behandlede den storsindede Gudmunds ih\u00e6nder\u00ab&amp;nbsp; (see Skjaldedigtn. A II p. 397; MS. AM 396, 4to, from about1400). Tihe word is also found in Flj\u00e1tsd\u00e6la hin meiri, occurring on p. 21 of the edition (Kr. K\u00e1lund, K\u00f8benliavn 1883): iotuninbreider fra sier l\u00e1mana (thus here used of a giant's paws). The MiS. in question is from t/he first half of tihe 17th century andwas likely written in North Ioeland. The word exists in Modern Icelandic, but the weak form l\u00e1mi seems to ibe the chief form.However tliis may be, Bl\u00f3ndals dictionary 'has tlhe following: l\u00e1mi m. (pop.) Lab, Grabbe, l\u00e1mur m. (pop) = l\u00e1mi, l\u00e1mur f. pl.(pop.) Grabber. The word is unknown in Norwegian, but Shetland Norn lamek \u00bbpaw, big clumsy hand; handful\u00ab (see JakofoJakobsen, Etymologisk ordbog over det norr\u00f8ne sprog p\u00e1 Sfoe;- land) is most likely the same word, and so is Orkney Nornlawmo (Jakofosen: lomo) \u00bbthe hand etc.\u00ab (see Marwiok, The Orkney Norn). In Faroese the word is correct as to form, but the meaning varies. L\u00e1mur m. means \u00bbfront l'eg of an animal\u00ab (pes anterior animalis), especially of a cat (pes felis anterior), though it can also mean, according to a note of Jakob Jakobsen's taken down in Su\u00f0uroy, fron\u00ed flipper of a seal, in sorne plaoes furtiher: Ihuman hand, \u00bbpaw\u00ab. In Modern Faroese the word almost always has the meaning \u00bbleft hand, left paw\u00ab and \u00bbone who is left-ihanded\u00ab, formerly kjall\u00e1mur [cadl\u00e1amor] sometimes [catl\u00e1amorj. This word, occurring in the digiionary MSS. from the 18tlh to the ibeginning of the 19th century as kjadlaamur m. (sinistra manus, sinislra utens manu prae dextra) can hardly be anyithipg eJse than -\u00edlhe Scots Gaelic word foir \u00bbleft-hand\u00ab l\u00e1mh chearr, which first dhanged to 'kjarr-l\u00e1mr, later to *kj&amp;lt;mrl\u00e1m(u)r and finally (rl &amp;gt; 11 &amp;gt; dl) to [cadl\u00e1amor], writien kjall\u00e1mur- Thus Faroese has borrowed the Gaelic word for left-hand, placing the adjective first as in Norse. When l\u00e1mur means \u00bbleft hand\u00ab or \u00bbleft-handed man\u00ab etc. it may be an abbreviated form of kjall\u00e1mur.",

As to the main part of the work we arrive at a population of some 3180 about 1600. The method employed in reaching this number has been to copy a total number all names on the rent-roll(collumn A); this gives a total number of 532 names (p. 9). However, a closer examination of these names discloses the factthat a great number of them are mentioned twice or even several times, hence a reduction in the total number of entriesis necessary. This has been made in column B, and the actual number of maintainers tums out to be 436 (p. 33). The lattermay be supposed to represent a family of 5 persons each. Result: 2180 persons. But, in addition, a probable number of farm workers, male and female, and pensioners must be taken into account \u2014 a number wlhich has been estimated at about 1000. Accordingly the total Faroese population about 1600 will be as mentioned above.",

    "abstract": "Las\u00ed win^er (1953\u201454) I was asked to identify a number of Faeroese specimens of Hieracia belonging to the collection of Mr.Rasmus Rasmussen, a former headmaster in T\u00f3rshavn. These ^specimens had been coljected bj him several years ago in various focalities in ,tihe Faeroes. I had never before studied species of Hieracia from rhe Faeroes, and therefore I felt tihe need for cornparative material, especially as examples 'belonging to tihe Faeroes species were not availahle i:i Iceland. The Botanical Museums of Stodkholm and Copenhagen did me fee great favour to letnd to me all their specimens of Faeroese Hieracia, and for tlhis I sihould like to express my most cordial thanks. 24 species of Hieracia are known from the Faeroes (Dahlstedt 1903). \u2014 Undoubtedly one of these species, viz. //. danicum Da'hlst. was lintroduced during recent times. \u2014 In the collection entrusted ito me I found 13 of ,the species previously described and also some doubt&amp;nbsp;ful specimens. However, besides this, I found 6 mew species&amp;nbsp;and one new variety. Among tlhese there is a fine example of a species belonging to tfae Alpina Section, \u00edbut hitherto no species of tfais section ihas been recorded from Faeroes. This seems to stress the need for more detailed invesligations on the Hieraciumflora of .tlhe isles. The paper eontains original descriptions of the new species.\r\nThe type specimens are preserved in the collection of the Natural History Museum in T\u00f3rshavn, Faeroes. Alpina. H. Rasmussenii n. sp. (vide pag. 116), which belongs to Alpina Genuina, is a very interesting speoies as mo specimens of that Seotion have previously been found in tihe Faeroes.\r\nUnfortunately it is represented foy one example only. Its further distribution is at presernt no,t known, and it is not po,:i3\u00cdble toevaluate its eventual variaibility. This new species is distinguished by its black glands, O'n the wihole etem, by its sm-all subentire radical leaves, tlhe sligihtly developied stem-leaves, the lack of bracts about tihe summit of tlhe stem, and iby its darkish and unusual long-pilose involucre.\r\nComparing the present specimen with Icelandic species of, this Section it does inol seem ito be closely allied ;to any of thase. As to tihe indumentum of tlhe oharaoteristic involucre k resemibles H. tamxacifrons O&amp;amp;karss. from W.-Iceland, and ithe shape of 'tihe radical leaves is very similar to hhat of H- percome Om., tmt in all other riespeols it differs essentially from t'hese two Icelandic Alpina. Vulgata. H. saxunense, n. sp. (vide pag. 117) is closely related to H. subcordijrons Daihlst. fout it differs fromthat species \u00edn faaving slenderer and lower growtfa, narrower and longer inmer radical leaves and a lower stem-leaf. All tfae leaves are of deeper green colour T pilose above, and witfaouit cordate Liase. Flhyllaries are narrower, more acuminate and conspicuously floccose. I faave compared many specimens of H. subcordijrons from different localities with the present specimens.\r\nBuit as I have not been able ito find intermediate atages between them, I tlhink it justifiafole to raise llhe form mentioned toa specific rank. Cerinthoidea. Hieracium haplodonlum n. sp. (vide pag. 119). This species is most closely allied to H. peramplijorrne Dahlst. and H. melanochrotum Dafalst. It differs mainly from tfaem iby having foroader and characteristic deltoid dentate radical leaves, wihich are more pilose above, tfae large obovate sfaaped lower stemleaf,&amp;nbsp;\r\nby efloccose and more densely glandular involucres and longtootihed Hgules. Tridentata. H. nannocaulon n. sp. (vide pag. 120)belongs undoulbtedly to the Section Tridentata and it is closely allied to H- epileucoides Dahlst. It is mainly distinguished from t\u00edhat species by having mudh lower stem, ibright green, duraible and densely placed radical leaves, no teaves (only ibracts) a'bout tbe upper half of tlie s\u00edem, and by less 'hairy involucres and shoiter teeth of the ligules. In .l'he H. naninocaulon material I found 3 specimens somewihat different from the type. Wlhellher t\u00edhey belong to anobher :new species of Tridentata or they are referable as a variety to H. nannooaulan I caji not rstate because of too scanty material. These specimens Ihave 2\u20143 radical leaves, 3\u20145 fairly well developed stem-leaves and longer teetlh of the ligules. They remind one of a new Ioelandic species: H. hologlossum Oskarss. from S.E.-Iceland, 'bu\u00ed they can not 'be neferred to it. Hieracium stictopliorum, n. sp. ((vide pag. 121). Of tliis species only one specimen with undeveloped flowierheads is available. But as it ihas distinct features, I think it reasonalbleto describe it. H. stictophorum is dharacterized by nelatively large purpligh-lbrown-bloldhed radical Ieaves, one small stem-leaf,fairly densely pilose and glandular peduncles and iby copiously microglandular iivolucres. The systematic place of tihis plant isnot perfeotly clear, but I Chink tihat it is in closest relation witih Tridentata, to wihioh Section I provisionally refer it. Among Faeroese species it comes nearest to H. epileucoides Dahlst., hut that species presents some essential points of difference from H. slictophorum e. g. as to ilhe foliage and t'he indumentum of tihe infloresceincje.\r\niBritiish and Icelandic Tridemtata spegies also differ widely from itihis new form. Alpestria. H. scolophjllum m. sp. (vide pag. 122), is undoubtedly closely allied to the Semidovrensia species H. Hartzianum Dahlst., but it diiffers from i,t in several particulars. Radical leaves are all acuminate\u2014sufoulaite, never oibtuse, witihout stellate hairs and more densely pilose on theirsurfaces; ,tlhe inflorescence is more qcntracted, wiith much shorter acladium, lower and more floccose involucres and darker styles. Hieracium Hartzianum. Dahlst. var. heteroglochin nova v. (vide p. 123). 3 specimeins of this form from same locality are ait hand, and tihese are of fairly different appearance. Judging from their general facies we migjht think that tihey were an intermediate form between H. Hartzianum Daihlst. and H. Ostenjeldii Dahlst. But&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;after ihaving investigated tlhem more closely, it is evident that they are more allied to H. Hartzianum. Therefore I have provisionally re\u00ederred tlhem as a variety to that species. This variety differs from H. Hartzianum in its narrower and more irregularly itoothed radical leaves, in its smaller heads, lower involiucres, and in more sitellately hairy phyllaries. Perhaps this new form is of more independent nature than 1suspect, Ibut only investigation on more material in order to compare it with H. Hartzianum can prove this.",

Special studies of the Hepialus humuli seem to allow the following conglusion: In tlhe Faroes, as in Shetland, a very changeable variety of the male Hepialus humuli is to be found. The variety is very like the forma thuleus Crotch (hethlandica Staudinger) and ought to be called: forma jaeroensis.\nThe author does not agree with Annandale \u00edhat the colour of the male is simply approaching the colour of the female, but points out that the colour of the former is passing the constant colour of tihe female, growing darker than and different frorn the colour of the latter. Most likely the ohange of colour of the male is now a defence against dangers in nature, in this case the birds, and on that account of vital importance to the animal.",

    "abstract": "In tlhe 32 years fronn 27/6/1920 to 26/6/1952 there were 124 cases of canoer in the medical district of Ei\u00f0i, iFaroe Islands. The average population was 2256, giving 17,2 inew cases per 10.000 iinihabitants. The 124 cases are given in Table I aceording to the location of the oomplakit and 'the outcome was \u00edhat 101 of tbe 124 died of cancer. The mortality rate f ox canoer was thus 14 per 10.000 inhabitants. 3 otlher persons had canoer when they died, but this was not the cause of deatih. 7 were operated on for cainoer, and were apfparentlly free from i,t at death, though recidivity was etill possible.&amp;nbsp;\r\n3 persons operated on for oanoer wexe still living in June 1954. 2 of them without metastasis but reoidivky and meljastasis were st\u00edil possibillities. At the end of the period there was 1 case of cancer in tlhe distriot. Ten were cured. Persons were only Qonsidered cured if there were no recedivity or metastasis 5 years after the operation.\r\nThe fatal cases are shown on Table II accordiing to age and sex. Cancer cutis (jacies). Iin 7 cases Qancer began on the face. 1 oft\u00ediese was operated on in 1929 for canoer of the nose, in 1930 for cancer on the lefit temple, in 1932 for a canoerous induration on the forehead and in 1941 a cancerous swelling on tlhe aipper lip was removed. There will soarcely have been any connection between tlhese growths.\r\nCancer labii inf. Tbere are 2 men and 2 women with this form of the disease. The 2 meai ihave been invenerate pipe smokers since youljh. They were operated on in 1925 and 1922 aged 76 and 67 respeatively. They had both had cancer of the lower lip onoe before.\r\nTihe first man had &amp;lt;tlhe original cancerous induration removed in 1909, the second in 1919. The isores were near the coraers of the 'inouilih; nei'Jher of them had oancer on the samie side -twice. One of the women too had been a confirmed pipe-smoker. Her itumour was removed in 1924, when she was 85 years old. In the casc of the other woman, ithe cancer which appeared roughly in ithe middle of the lip seemed to have h&amp;amp;gn caused by a loose tooth m the upper jaw_ whioh for a long time had continuaJly been striking that point on tihe lip wlhere Iater an ulcex formed. It was removed in 1932, the patient being 66.\r\nCancer ventriculi. Not less than 45 suffered and died from cancer ventriculi, acoouting for 45 % of all deaths and for 36 % ofall cases. By far the greater nuxnber were women (27 as against 18 men). Up to the age of 65 there was about as many women as men, but after that age many more women tlhan men.&amp;nbsp;\r\nancer wesicae felleae. 2 men died of this disease. Neither of them had quiite natural gall bladders before the onset of cancer. The lder man was operated on in 1938, aged 58; he had had aa attack of gall stones with jaundice in 1935. On being operated the gaU bladder was found to 'be so hard 'that it was impossible to say if it still contained stones or not. Tihe ot\u00edher patient was operated on for gall stones in 1927, when over 100 were over removed. He beeame a paratyphoid carrier in JNov. 1945. Ici 1948 he wished to be operated on for ithe removal of the gall bladder in the hope of getting rid 'of the paratyphoid bacilli. The operation revealed gall stones again and, quite unexpectedly, cancer vesicae felileae. He died the same year, aged 51.Cancer maminae, occured in 19 womem, aind caused the death of 13. 2 oild women wiho were opera.ted on died 2 and 9 moaths respeotively after the operation of dementia senihs. They lived for too ishoit a period for one to say wether ithey would have ever been cured. In the case of a woman operated on in 1951, it is still too early to pass judgement. 3 patients reoovered. The woimeai wiho had had children seem ito have cancer at an earlier age than those who had had none. IIJ no fewer than 11 of the 19 cases the cancer arose in the gands of the brast whiclh had either been the seat of disease, often long before the onset of cancer or were already oitherwise aibnormal. Tahle VI. 2 of ithe 19 had cancer in boith breasts; in the case of one it began in the left breast gland, with the oither in the right. Only 4 over the remaining 17 had the disease in ilhe right hreasit, w\u00edhereas 13 \u00edhad it in the left. Pathologic anatomical findings are given in Table VIII. 8 cases oj sarcoma,. including ithe oase of 1 man aged 56 who died in 1951 of ohondroisarcoima metastasis. The disease began on the basic bone of the 4th toe on the left foot. This bone was in any case frorn \u2022the lOth or l l th year onwards wider ithan the corresponding one on the ileft foo,t. In 1942 it was atruok by a ]&amp;gt;iece of stone during blasting, after which the growth in question appeared.\r\nFrom the foregoing it is appearenit that &amp;gt;time after itime a purely medhanical aotion has provoked ihe outbreak of cancer, a,s with all 4 cases of c. ]abii. inf. (pipe and loose tooth) and wiith hoih cases of c. vesicae felleae (gall stcines). The same can be said abonit one man with chondrosarcoma, whose disease was provoked ithrough his being struck hy a istone. To this may be added that a good quarter of llhe 19 cases of c. mammae had had mastitis in the same breast while in more than half of the 19 cases the breast gland was in some way abnormal.",

Detailed investigations were not carried out at the time, but according to men working on the site, Brogger2 thought that they had possibly come across the remains of a sacrifice from the early period of the colonisation of the Faroes.\r\nII. Investigations were undertaken at the spot in the summer of 1953; two sections were cut some two metres east of where the bones and drift wood were previously found: E\u2014V (Fig. 1 and 2) and N\u2014S (Fig. 3) and the strata examined. Taking into account the subsidence known to have taken place and comparing with Jessen^ and Brogger2 we conclude that the terminus ad quem should not be fixed earlier than the middle of the (Norse) Middle Ages and that the site appears to have been exposed until the 19th century. It may be thought that these bones had been washed up or thrown together where they were found; remains ofseaweed and shell-fragments indicate this supposition.",

    "abstract": "This article seeks to answer the questions: what sort of willow was called p\u00e1lmi (palm) in the Faroes and was it of native growth or imported. In the Middle Ages willows in Scandinavia were called \u00bbpalms\u00ab, for they were used as decorations on Palm Sundays. / . C. Svabo1 (1782) and / . Landt'- (1800) are the first authors to write about the name p\u00e1lmi, but even then it was already ancient in the Faroes. Svabo and Landt equate it with Salix caprea, though this can hardly be correct, for the plant growing in all the places they mention is Salix phylicifolia. Landt writes that the p\u00e1lmi was brought to the Faroes from Norway about 1660; Svabo has no remarks o:i this point. Later authors in asserting that the p\u00e1lmi vas introduced from Norway aremerely following Landt. The reports have it that one, Ole Larvesen, bailiff on Eysturoy, brought these willows from Norway, planting them at Strendur about 1660 and that his sister moved them to \u00d8rav\u00edk. Naturally the reports give no indication whether Salix caprea or Salix phylicifolia is meant. Svabo and Landt must be responsible for the confusion of names. Closerinvestigation, however, shows that the accounts alleging that the plant was introduced from Norway are contradictory and of little value.\r\nFinally, a few words about the two \u00bbpalms\u00ab. S. caprea has been introduced in historical times and ia found only on cultivated land. It does not occur in peat. S. phylicifolia is native to the Faroes and is found widely troughout the contry in the following places: Eysturoy: Strendur, Toftavatn, Streymoy: Hvalv\u00edk, T\u00f3rshavn, Kv\u00edv\u00edk, Sandoy: Tra\u00f0arhamar, Su\u00f0uroy: \u00d8rav\u00edk, Kunoy: Heima \u00ed H\u00fasi, V\u00e1gar: Leitisvatn, Nor\u00f0tri\u00f0ingur, Mi\u00f0v\u00e1gur, Uttanh\u00fas. In addition it occurs in peat at T\u00f3rshavn 'm V\u00e1gsbotnur,Sk\u00e1lav\u00edk (leaves and stems), Hoyv\u00edk (stems). It may well be that many twigs hitherto thougt to be from Juniperus are really from Salix. It is most likely that p\u00e1lmi orginally denoted the indigenous Salix phylicifolia.",

    "abstract": "\u00edn two previous essays (Magnussen 1949, 1950) the author presented in condensed form the results of studies on the influence of oxygen tension, carbon dioxide tension and hydrogen ion concentration on the production of erythrocytes in vitro. The present article gives a more exhaustive account of the difficulties bound up with such investigations and describes in more detail the author's technique which mainly differs from that of Osgood and Plum as follows:1. The investigations were made in Warburg vessels in water, both at 38\u00b0 C.2. The vessels were kept in constant motion to prevent sedimentation (Fig. 1).3. Agglutinations were avoided by using serum from blood kept at 2\u00b0\u20144\u00b0 for 24 hours, and then the serum must not show any signs of hemolysis. Moreover the suspension must be kept for a period of 20 minutes before serum is added.\r\nIn section I. a comparison is made between the production of erythrocytes in 100 %, 80 %, 50 %, 40 %, 30 %, 10 %, 5 %, 2~y% % oxygen and in ordinary atmospheric air (20, 95 % 0 2 ) . The results of some of the experiments are seen in Fig. 2\u20147: (Fig. 2 Production of erythrocytes in vitro in air compared with nitrogen containing 2.5 % 02 . \u2014 Fig. 3\u20147. Production of erythrocytes in vitro in air compared with nitrogen containing 5 % 0 2 ) . The total results are shown in tables (Table 1\u20148), and the final results can easily be read off from Curves (Fig. 8\u20149) which indicate that the maximum production of erythrocytes was seen at10\u201430 % of oxygen. The production was inhibited at 40 % and 5 % of oxygen and completely arrested at 50 % and 2 % %\u2022 Thus the optimal production was observed at the physiological oxygen tension.\r\nIn section II. the production of erythrocytes was similarly examined in 3 % and 6 % of carbon dioxide in relation to atmospheric air (Table 9\u201412). A special investigation was made to see what influence pH has on bone marrow cells in vitro. These resultsmay be seen in Table 13 in addition all the results are seen in a co-ordinate system; this co-ordinate system is seen in Figure 10 from which it is evident that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide inhibit the formation of red blood cells from bone marrow in vitro. An inhibition of the same magnitude is seen when the pH in the solution is altered to values corresponding to those found in the samples with increased carbon dioxide. It may be concluded thal carbon dioxide has now effect on its own, but that the effect observed is due to the resultant increased hydrogen ion concentration in the medium. It must, however, be emphasized that these results from experiments in vitro do not exclude the possibility of decreased oxygen tension or increased carbon dioxide tension playing a part in the formation of red blood cells in vivo.\r\nIt is tempting to suggest that blood formation in vivio may be controlled indirectly, e. g. through an effect on the capillariesin the bone marrow, perhaps via the nervous system. Further investigations are, however, necessary to decide whether this assumption is right or not.",

    "abstract": "Two cases of toxoplasmosis occurred in the Faroes in October and December 1951. The first patient was an eight year old boy who fell ill with adenitis colli immediately after recovering from measles. In the case of the other patient, a man of 51, the illness strongly suggested sepsis; he ran a temperature, at times high, for six weeks. Toxoplasma reactions in the blood were markedly positive with both patients. The source of infeotion is unknown, but suspicion falls on the cats belonging to the patients' homes. One of these cats died of an unknown and uninvestigated complaint, which could conceivably have been toxoplasmosis. The other cat showed a positive neutralisation reaction (1:50) a year and a half after the owner's illness.Blood from 22 adults, all living at home, was tested during 1952 and 1953 with toxoplasma reactions. 16 tests were negative, 5 showed very slight positive neutralisation reactions (1:10), while in a single case both reactions were positive (1:250 and 1:4). In this case the dog living in the house may well have been the source of infection. In 1947 this animal was attacked by a very prevalent, infectious and often fatal canine disease.",

Three of the meningitis cases constituted the final stage of preceding miliary tuberculosis; the patients were ill for between two and four months before death. In the remaining 14 cases meningitis was primary, death following after two to three weeks illness. The frequency of meningitis among &amp;gt;the invertors was 4 %. The following observations were made with regard to the intervalbetween inversion and the occurrence of meningitis: The majority, about 70 %, of the meningitis cases occurred within six months of inversion (1. table). With children all cases occurred within the first year after inversion (2. table), with adults, 11 cases in all, nine occurred within the first year, while two appeared much later, two and a half and three years respectively, after the primary tuberculous infection (3. table).",

    "abstract": "In a provisional review an account is given of an examination of ^/g of the population of the Faroe Islands. Of 11.000 persons examined, 312 were found to be suffering from psoriasis (158 men, 154 women), the incidence of the disease being 2.84 %. The investigation covered all cases, specially including patients who would not normally seek medical advice. At the time of the examination 13 % had major eruptions, 76 % had minor eruptions, while 11 % were without symptoms. As psoriasis is almost untreated on the islands, it is possible to form an opinion as to the spontaneous course of the disease. Only 15.5 % showed constant major dissemination, 72.9 % showed either constant minor dissemination or a course with very few symptoms. 11.6 % had had constant major eruptions in early life, but on growing older have had only minor eruptions. 42 % of all patients havegone through periods of major eruptions; 44.9 % have had periods quite free from symptoms. A few of the many comprehensive genealogical tables drawn up are shown. The most extensive of these includes 34 cases of psoriasis distributed over f ive generations. Psoriasis is seen to be inherited dominantly with failing manifestation. The manifestation probability is calculated to be about 40 %. A more detailed account of these investigations will be published later.&amp;nbsp;",

    "abstract": "Hans Debes Joensen: On the umbilical hernia in infancy (hernia umbilicalis infantum).1. A short account of the umbilical region and hernias in this region is given. Variations in terms are mentioned and special attention is called to disagreements in view of the pathogenesis of the umbilical hernia of adult life (umbilical or paraumbilical).2. Advanced etiological factors in infantile umbilical hernia and its dependence on birth weight, season and race are reported.3. 4270 infants, born 1939\u201442 in Holb\u00e6k county medical district, Denmark, were examined by public health nurses about 15 times during the first year of life. 18,5 per cent of the infants demonstrated umbilical hernia. Sex exerted little influence on the frequency of umbilical hernia&amp;nbsp;inasmuch as the boys exceeded the girls by only 2,3 percent. The sexual predominance is far more evident in small infants. Birth weight is of decisive import. The frequency of the umbilical hernia varies inversely with the birth weight of the infant. Very big infants demonstrate a slight tendency to more umbilical hernias than do infants with average birth weight (table 1).\r\nRegular seasonal variations of the incidence of umbilical hernia could not be demonstrated (2. table, figure 1). Nearly all the cases of umbilical hernia, 90,7 percent, first appear in the 1. quarter of life, very few in the 3. and 4. quarter (3. table).\r\nAll cases of umbilical hernia with the exception of 7 were treated with application of a broad strip of adhesive plaster across the abdomen. According to the nurses the incidence of umbilical hernia after this treatment was only 1,17 per cent at the age of one year, in 0,39 per cent the result was unknown (4. table).\r\nAs there is no available group of children without plastertreatment, it is not possible to determ\u00edne the value of the applied treatment. Undoubtedly it is of great value, but the author supposes the incidence of umbilica hernia found by the nurses after treatment at the age of one year to be too low, compared with other statistics. He therefore personally has examined 104 children aged 2 to 6 year from the Queen Ingrid's kindergarten in T\u00f3rshavn and found only 2 cases of real umbilical hernia. The real frequency in properly strapped white infants at the age of one year therefore scarcely exceeds 5 per cent.\r\nOf all cases of umbilical hernia about 85 per cent were cured by one continuous plastertreatment without any relapse before the age of one year. The others relapsed one or many times during the first year of life, but apparently only 6\u20149 per cent still persisted at the age of one year (5. table).\r\nWhile high pressure in the abdomen and rachitis scarcely is of any importance as etiologic factors, these factors (bronchitis, pertussis and maybe rachitis) are of considerable import for the result of the treament and the relapse.\r\n4. The suitability of surgical treatment of the umbilical hernia in childhood is diseussed, but it is concluded, that investigations on the pathogenesis of the umbilical hernia in adult life (umbilical or paraumbilical) and on the total disappearance or not of the sac in the infantile umbilical hernia still are to be performed to solve this problem.",

    "abstract": "This paper is part of a treatise dealing with the clinical features of primary tuberculous infection, and the purpose of the present work is to contribute to the clinic of primary tuberculosis. Some literature about the theme is surveyed. The material used has been collected at the Tuberculosis Station of the Faroe Islands at Hoydal during the author's time of service there from 1939 to 1947. An account is given of the working plan of this tuberculosis station, where besides ordinary station work special attention is paid to the tuberculin register. The tuberculin reaction used has been Pirquet 's test. The material comprises a total of 430 cases of initial fever.\nThe fever curve for adults was typically continual, while with children it vas irregular; the duration of the fever was similar for children and adults, generally 2 or 3 weeks; in l/4 of the cases it lasted more than one month. Maximum temperature generally about 39 degrees C might, however, be higher, especially with children. The duration and height of the fever had no prognostic significance. Slow pulse was a constant symptom witli adults, but was seldom noticed with children. This relative bradycardiagenerally lasted till the middle of ihe fever period. Krythema nodosum was a frequent symptom ot' initial fever and occurred 76 times among the 430 cases of initial fever.\nSedimentation rate practically always increased, as a rule moderately, and decreased as the fever fell, but more slowly. X-rays examinations have been made during initial fever in 146 cases. X-rays changes were stated in all the children and in more than % of the adults. The changes stated were chifly enlarged hilar shadows, some had also infiltrations. Rather more than *4 had subjective symptoms, a number which is undoubtedly too low. The most frequent symptoms where retrosternal pain and soreness of the lower end of sternum, a stitch in the side, and pain between the shoulderblades. The mentioned symptoms must be supposed to bi' caused by tlie pathologic anatomic changes.",
