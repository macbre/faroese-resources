<h1>The Doctor-conflict</h1>
<cite>Hans Andrias Sølvará: The Rise of Faroese Separatism</cite>
<p>The Doctor-conflict developed in 1955 into an armed combat between separatist minded citizens in Klaksvík and 132 Danish marines and 32 Danish police officers, which the Danish Government at the request by the Landsstýrið had sent to Klaksvík with the warship Rolf Krake. A bomb exploded at the police station in Klaksvík in November 21, 1955.</p>
<p>Three out of four police officers at the station were hospitalized, but no one was seriously hurt.</p>
<p>This was neither the first nor the strongest bomb that exploded in Klaksvík in November 1955.</p>
<p>Furthermore, three days later, on November 24, a bomb, which had been ignited, but for some reason never exploded, was discovered in a the  house in Klaksvík.</p>

<p>The general election to the Løgting on November 8, 1946, could not demonstrate a majority for the implementation of the result of the referendum.</p>
<p>While the People´s Party together with Jákup í Jákupsstovu before the election had the majority in the Løgting (12-11), the People´s Party after the election had only 8 out of 20 representatives in the Løgting, – Jákup í Jákupsstovu who was excluded from the Social Democratic Party on September 22, was not re-elected – while the Home Rule Party (2), the Social Democratic Party (4) and the Unionist Party had 12 representatives. Therefore, after further negotiations, Faroese and Danish negotiators agreed on the Home Rule Law from 1948, where the Danish authorities for the first time acknowledged the Løgting legislative power in Faroese matters. This, of course, considerably reduced the political importance of the Faroese members of the Danish Parliament in relation to legislation in the Faroe Islands, which was now mainly the political responsibility of the Løgting, but their importance in relation to Danish politics was unchanged.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a Faroese Government, Landsstýri, was established and led by a Prime Minister with the ancient title Løgmaður, which had not existed since the Løgting and the Løgmaður were abolished in 1816. At the same time, the Løgting, which in 1934 had been authorized to collect some taxes in the Faroe Islands, eventually received full authorization to collect all the taxes in the Faroe Islands.</p>
<p>Foreign policy including defence policy and international agreements remained under the Danish state authorities.</p>
<p>Thus, the Faroese referendum on September 14, 1946 forced the Danish authorities to give the Faroese people a more extensive home rule than they originally intended, but they managed to avoid that the Faroe Islands gained independence from Denmark. Matt Qvortrup claims that the Faroese referendum in 1946 together with the similar referendum in Western Australia on April 8, 1933 is only example of a successful referendum that has not led to independence (Qvortrup 2014: 29 and 51 ff). However, the negotiations about the Home Rule Act were interpreted by Faroese separatists as treason against the decision at the referendum and thus led to the Republican Party (1948), which was founded by the members of the Føroyingafelag.</p>
<p>From a Danish point of view, the preservation of the constitutional relations between the Faroe Islands, whose geopolitical importance in the North Atlantic became very important during the Cold War, and Denmark increased in importance after the Second World War. The Home Rule Act, which placed the authority over the Faroese foreign and defence policy in Copenhagen, harmonized nicely with the new Cold War order, where Denmark could become an important player in a western defence allience against the USSR. Further, the USA preferred that the Faroe Islands remained under Danish sovereignty and that the islands in that way became an integral part of of the western mili- tary defence system (Johansen 1999: 20). It has recently been argued that the Danish authorities already during the negotiations about the Home Rule Act were aware of this growing strategic importance of the Faroe Islands and that they deliberately kept the topic in secret from the Faroese negotiators who were ignorant of and therefore unable to utilize the topic in the negotiations (Thorsteinsson 1999: 40- 41). However, the assertion that the Danish state authorities already in 1947-48 – i.e. before Denmark in 1949 signed the NATO treaty – were aware of the post-war strategic importance of the Faroe Islands during the Cold War has been disputed (Jensen 2004: 28), but it is on the other hand a fact that independent of a subsequent Cold War context it was already in 1941 generally recognized, by the British as well as by the Norwegians, that the Faroe Islands already were strategically very important in modern warfare (Jensen 1972: 41-42). The result was, anyway, that Denmark had the sovereignty over the Faroe Islands and thus preserved the authority over the islands foreign and defence policy.</p>
<p>Consequently, several passed proposals in the Løgting, e.g. in 1940 and in 1970, which demanded that the Faroe Islands should be neutral in relation to all military alliances, were not taken seriously by the Danish Government who according to the Home Rule Act had preserved the sovereignty over the Faroe Islands. Nor were the Faroese authorities asked, when the NATO treaty was implemented in the Faroe Is- lands in 1952 (Sølvará 2002: 321-23).</p>
<p>This international development subsequently paved the way for a strong case for a Faroese separatist critique of Denmark and the Home Rule Act. The Republican Party, whose leader was Erlendur Patursson, the son of the late Jóannes Patursson, who died on August 2, 80 years old, only some few weeks before the 1946 referendum, challenged the Home Rule System on many issues. The left wing Republican Party achieved growing acceptance in the economically turbulent 1950ies because of its strong opposition to the Danish authorities’ implementation of the NATO treaty in the Faroes and its strong support for the demands from the Fishermen´s Association, whose leader also was Erlendur Patursson (Sølvará 2002: 321-23).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the republican left wing party also opposed the right wing politics of the Faroese Government, which during most of the 1950ies was led by Kristian Djurhuus from the Unionist Party. Particularly in the northern islands, where a convincing majority on September 14, 1946 had voted for separation (Sølvará 2013a: 16) and the fishing industry was particularly strong, the left wing policy of the new Republican Party evoked a response.</p>
<p>It was in this context that a Danish Doctor (Olaf Halvorsen) with a disputed Nazi past in Denmark during the Second World War was denied permanent occupation at the hospital in Klaksvík, the leading industrial city in the northern islands.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of the citizens in the northern islands demonstrated in 1952-53 in favour of the very popular Danish doctor and against the central (hospital) authorities in Tórshavn who had employed a Faroese Doctor (Eivind Rubek Nielsen) who was related to the leading industrial family in Klaksvík (Sølvará 2013a: 10-52 and Sølvará 2014a: 10-44). Subsequently, this Faroese conflict, which originated in disputes between the leading city of the fishing industry in the north and the administrative capital in the south,81 on the discursive level was utilized by e.g. the Republican Party leader to construct a political conflict between Faroese freedom fighters and oppressive Danish authorities.82 In fact, the Faroese authorities were reluctant to ask for help from the likewise reluctant Danish state authorities who would not interfere without an explicit request from the Faroese authorities.83 Even at this late point in the mid 1950ies, when the strategic importance of the Faroe Islands for the western defence alliance had become obvious to everybody, the Danish authorities were so reluctant to interfere in the conflict that the political development, especially the agitation of the Faroese independence movement, was skeptically noted by the Americans, who would have preferred an earlier Danish political intervention – but they also noted that something ought be done to solve the deep economic crises in the Faroe Islands (Johansen 1999: 20-23). According to a subsequent Danish Court judgment in March 1956, this Danish reluctance to interfere against obvious lawlessness since March 1953 might also have weakened the perception among citizens in Klaksvík of what was acceptable (Sølvará 2013: 270). Thus, when the Danish state authorities responding to the Faroese Government request in late April 1955 and subsequently also in late September eventually did interfere with armed forces, warships with large numbers of police officers and dogs in Klaksvík, the way was paved to a construction of the conflict in relation to a national-political discourse, alien to the local Faroese origin, which made it escalate into an armed battle between citizens in Klaksvík and the Danish police force. This discursive national turn, which e.g. was made possible because of the context relating to the Danish police intervention, was even acknowledged in unionist circles in the Faroe Islands.</p>
<p>The local newspaper in Klaksvík, whose editor was a unionist, claimed in November 1955 that the Danish attempt to use Danish police officers in order to establish law and order in the city had mainly failed because of the existing “national opposition” in the Faroe Islands (Norðlýsið, November 25, 1955). The conclusion drawn by the editor was that the only possible way to overcome the national opposition was to establish a Faroese police force to take care of the situation. However, at that time, bombs were already exploding in Klaksvík.</p>
<p>This Doctor-conflict basically originated in local Faroese disputes,84 but cleverly utilized and contextualized in the backdrop of the independent minded majority in the north served in part to help the Republican Party gain acceptance in the Faroe Islands. In 1958, only 10 years after the foundation in the aftermath of the referendum in 1946, which nearly has gained a mythical political status among separatists in the Faroe Islands, the party became the largest in the north, and it has since been one of the four major political parties in the Faroe Islands.</p>
<p>This ´four big political party structure` still dominates the political landscape in the islands. The question of separation from Denmark has since been an important part of the political discourse in the Faroe Islands, but only occasionally has it played a tangible political role.</p>
<p>Interestingly, separatism still appears to be a mainly discursive subject in Faroese politics, but a main change is that separatism also has become a positive part of the political discourse.</p>
<h3>Foot notes</h3>
<p>  81  It is obvious from an analysis of documents in the archive of the Head of Police and the Hospital Board at the National Archiver in Tórshavn on the subject that the popular Danish Doctor had a decisive influence on the citizens in Klaksvík. This is also evident from the content of a lot of letters, which are preserved in the private archive of Jacob Højgaard (Leader of the Faroese Doctor Union) that the Faroese Doctor Union got from citizens in Klaksvík. However, it is also evident from e.g. the subsequent inquieries made by the Head of Police in the subject that the fundamental societal origin to the conflict was the generally held view outside Tórshavn, especially in Klaksvík, that the power, decisions and even institutions were increasingly centralized in Tórshavn, the administrative capital.</p>
<p>82  The sorce material to use in analysing the conflict is extensive – see references. It is obvious from the private collections of Jacob Højgaard (Leader of the Faroese Doctor Union) and Hanus Debes Joensen Landslækni (Chief Medical Officer in the Faroes) that the conflict between the authorities in Tórshavn and Halvorsen/the majority in Klaksvík was deep. However, especially papers and private letters in the private collection of the republican Hanus Debes Joensen make it obvious that he as well as other leading academic republicans in Tórshavn were furious with Erlendur Patursson, whom they accused of utilizing and escalating the conflict for sole political reasons. This is also evident from papers in the private collection of the republican Karsten Hoydal who had lived in Klaksvík in 1946-50 and based on this experience also pointed out the socio-economical core in Klaksvík behind the Doctor-conflict. Contemporary sources from 1955 documents (e.g. the diary of Hartz-Laursen, a danish police officer in Tórshavn, from April 25, 1955, preserved in the archive of the Head of Police – Hartz-Laursen 1955: 4) that stories, which are retold in the subsequent popular and professional historiography (see e.g.</p>
<p>Hammerich 1983: 193-94; Asgaard 1990: 43-44; Elkjær-Hansen 1996: 152; Jensen 2006: 227 and Bø 2015: 201, 235 and 248), about heavily armed local citizens in Klaksvík and (advanced) bomb barriers at the entrance to the port in Klaksvík, constructed to defend Klaksvík against a repressive Danish army, were taken very seriously by the governments in Copenhagen and Tórshavn (e.g. Folketingstidende 1955: 4308), but according to the diary of the eyewitness Josias Matras, these stories were concocted (Matras, Diary, April 27, 1955), i.e. that they were discursive constructions without any tangible content. The clockmaker in Klaksvík who was supposed to have constructed the advanced bomb (the socalled “Hell Machine”) claimed on June 3, 1955: “the whole story is pure fantasy” (Police Report, June 3, 1955: 4 - Archive of the Head of Police, Læknastríðið í Klaksvík. Akter i lægesagen i Klaksvík.</p>
<p>Nr. 3. Rigsadvokaten 849/55 (7) 1955). However, these stories affected the actions of the Danish authorities and escalated the whole conflict.</p>
<p>83  This is obvious from an analysis of the documents in the archive of the Faroese Government (Føroya Landsstýri) at the National Archives in Tórshavn on the subject. This important archive also comprises corrospondence between the Faroese Government and the Danish Government. This is also evident in the memoirs of Niels Elkjær- Hansen who was the High Commissioner (The Representative of the Danish Government in the Faroes) in the Faroes in the 1950-ties (Elkjær-Hansen 1996: 125 and 127).</p>
<p>84  It is therefore, in my view, incorrect, when Líggjas í Bø in his recent book on the Doctor-conflict stresses the importance of oppressive Danish authorities, the Danish Government and the Danish Doctor Union (Bø 2015: 27 and 40-41). Originally, the Halvorsen supporters in Klaksvík struggled for a Danish Doctor against a Faroese Doctor; the majority in the Hospital Board, which led the Faroese Hospitals (e.g.</p>
<p>employed the Hospital Doctors) was Faroese; it was the Faroese Doctors in the Faroese Doctor Union (a subsection of the Danish Doctor Union) who demanded that Halvorsen resigned from the position as Hospital Doctor in Klaksvík; and it was the Faroese Doctor Union, which in reality decided to block the employment of the Hospital Doctor in Klaksvík and threatened that all Doctors in the Faroe Islands would resign if the Dane Halvorsen didn´t leave the Hospital in Klaksvík.</p>
<p>85  In an article about the home rule question from 2011, I have argued that apart from the period 1998-2002, the question of separatism has never played any tangible role in Faroese politics (Sølvará 2011a).</p>
