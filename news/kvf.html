<h2>Government widens trade focus to India, China, South Korea and Brazil</h2>

<p>The Faroese government wants closer trade ties with India.</p>

<p>For the second time in only a couple of months, the Indian Ambassador to the Kingdom of Denmark, Pooja Kapur, is visiting the Faroes.</p>

<p>Plans are in place to send a delegation of Faroese government officials and business leaders, headed by the Prime Minister, on an official trade visit to India in November.</p>

<p>Foreign minister Høgni Hoydal says he sees great potential in strengthening trade ties with the fifth largest economy in the world.</p>

<p>"India is a vast and diverse country. It is a major economic power, and its market is of great interest to us, especially our food exporters. We believe there is great potential for cooperation between our two countries," he says.</p>

<p>The planned trade visit to India would be the second of its kind. In 2006, Jóannes Eidesgaard, the then Prime Minister, travelled to India with a delegation of 26 Faroese industry representatives.</p>

<p>There has been some stagnation in trade between the two countries since then. However, new opportunities are now on the horizon.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Kapur has shown great interest in strengthening trade ties with the Faroes. A free trade agreement between the two countries may be difficult because we are not a sovereign state, but some trade agreements are definitely possible,” says Hoydal.</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/node/143968">US and Faroes to launch chamber of commerce</a></p>

<p>The government is also looking beyond India for possible trade ties.</p>

<p>“We are planning a trip to China later this year, and trips to Japan, South Korea and Brazil are also on our agenda,” he says.</p>

<p>The planned visits are a sign of the government’s growing ambition in the global marketplace.</p>

<p>Faroese autonomy in foreign relations is provided for by a treaty between the Faroes and Denmark, the Foreign Policy Act from 2005.</p>

<p>Large quantities of oil spilled onto the road along Dalavegur, Marknagilsvegur and Hvítanesvegur in Tórshavn on Saturday.</p>

<p>The oil also spread to numerous side streets due to the heavy rain.</p>

<p>A police car struggled to make it up the slippery Dalavegur hill to close the road.</p>

<p>A Magn tanker truck had leaked oil onto the road, reportedly due to a mechanical fault.</p>

<h1>DKK 200m state deficit projected for 2024</h1>
<h2>Economic council criticises government’s &#039;short-sighted&#039; budget plans</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/09/01/dkk-200m-state-deficit-projected-2024</address>

<p>The Faroese economy is strong, but there are huge challenges ahead. And politicians are doing far too little to address these challenges.</p>

<p>So said Fróði Magnussen, chairman of the Economic Council, when he presented the council’s autumn report this morning.</p>

<p>“It’s time for us to ramp up our rhetoric because we have been warning against government overspending for years. Yet we continue to see short-sighted budget planning,” he said.</p>

<p>The council expects a DKK 30 million state deficit for 2023, but the deficit is likely to surpass DKK 200 million in 2024, according to the new report.</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/05/30/shorter-work-week-economically-unwise">Shorter work week is “economically unwise”</a></p>

<p>“Seeing as we have virtually no unemployment and our tax revenues are higher than ever, we should expect a budget surplus. A surplus is crucial because government spending will rise massively in the coming years as the population is ageing,” he said.</p>

<p>“We need to make some structural changes and we must further increase our retirement age to ensure some sustainability in our economy. The longer we wait, the higher the bill we pass on to our children.”</p>

<p>He pointed out that whereas there are currently 4-5 workers per pensioner, this figure will soon go down to 2.5-3, depending on what pension reforms are implemented.</p>

<p>“If we exclude children from this equation, the worker-to-pensioner ratio will approach 1:1, which is obviously a cause for concern.”</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/node/144173">Report calls for tighter economic controls</a></p>

<p>Finance minister Ruth Vang was present at today’s presentation of the autumn report.</p>

<p>“I cannot say that I disagree with this criticism. We have been ambitious in our spending, perhaps too ambitious,” she said.</p>

<p>“We are looking at ways to increase our state revenues. Increasing the pension age is one way of doing this, but we are also looking for ways to limit the growth of our operational spending.”</p>

<p>She added that she will take the Economic Council’s report into consideration in her budget planning.</p>

<p>Franciscan nuns have been operating in the Faroes since 1931. But next summer, the remaining nuns will be leaving their positions.</p>

<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/31/nice-and-quiet-russian-ships-left</address>

<p>People living near major ports are enjoying a much quieter life now that up to 90 percent of Russian ships have <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/06/01/new-restrictions-russian-ships">disappeared</a>.</p>

<p>This is according to interest organisation Heimafriður (A quiet home), which aims to combat noise pollution.</p>

<p>The number of noise complaints from residents has dropped by 80-90 percent.</p>

<p>This figure is in line with the 80-90 percent decrease in Russian ships docking in Faroese ports since the partial port closure was implemented a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>If your children are not wearing a seat belt, you may risk penalty points on your driving licence.</p>

<p>Police have launched a traffic safety campaign on roads near schools across the country.</p>

<p>They are also on the lookout for children who wear their school bag on their back while sitting in the car, which is unsafe.</p>

<p>This specific campaign will continue for the next two weeks, but police are keeping an eye on school traffic all year.</p>

<h1>Poll: custody laws are biased against men</h1>
<h2>The first study of its kind in the Faroes looks at the daily lives, values and family affairs of men in the Faroes</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/29/poll-custody-laws-are-biased-against-men</address>

<p>Not many men in the Faroes believe that child custody laws treat men and women equally.</p>

<p>This is according to a new poll of 650 men aged 18-52, conducted in February and March last year.</p>

<p>The poll, which consisted of 136 questions, found that only 3 percent of men in the capital region believe that custody laws treat men and women equally.</p>

<p>This figure rose to 5 percent for men residing outside the capital region.</p>

<h1>Gender stereotypes still drive university choices</h1>
<h2>Despite more than half of university students being women, choices of study remain too gender-defined, says vice-chancellor</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/28/gender-stereotypes-still-drive-university-choices</address>

<p>Men and women should be encouraged to look beyond traditions when choosing their course of study.</p>

<p>So says Martin Zachariasen, vice-chancellor of the University of the Faroe Islands, in the wake of a <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/22/281-new-university-students">new year group</a> starting last week.</p>

<p>"Men are still more likely to study engineering, IT and finance, while women are more likely to study pedagogy and nursing.”</p>

<p>This notion, he says, is imprinted in children from an early age.</p>

<p>"Challenging the outdated notion that certain subjects are only for men or women would greatly benefit our labour market," he says.</p>

<p>“A growing body of research is showing that gender diversity in all levels on the labour market increases performance and quality.”</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/06/23/university-campus-design-revealed">University campus design revealed</a></p>

<p>There are improvements in this respect, he adds, mentioning that more women than men now study to become doctors and teachers, compared to 50 years ago when these professions were dominated by men.</p>

<p>However, he believes there is a long way to go before we achieve an ideal gender balance in study choices.</p>

<p>“There is no simple solution here, but I would encourage parents to start looking beyond conventions when talking to their children about what they want to do in the future,” he says.</p>

<p>“For example, if your daughter is good at maths and physics, why not suggest a subject like engineering? I recently read a really good interview with a female airline pilot. I think parents should shed light on role models who make unconventional career choices.”</p>

<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/27/closer-ties-eu-and-usa</address>

<p>Faroese relations with the United States are a high priority for the Faroese government.</p>

<p>Last year, an agreement on the participation of the Faroe Islands in EU programmes, with a specific protocol on its association to the EU scientific research initiative, Horizon Europe, was signed in Brussels.</p>

<p>This association brings value for the Faroese research community and constitutes a major pillar of the bilateral relations between the Faroe Islands and the EU.</p>

<h1>Sasha serves borsch on Ukraine’s Independence Day</h1>
<h2>Faroese people yesterday got the chance to taste Ukraine’s national dish in the Nordic House</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/25/sasha-serves-borsch-ukraines-independence-day</address>

<p>Yesterday marked Ukraine’s Independence Day, the day in 1991 when Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>One of the millions of Ukrainians who celebrated the day is Sasha Lysechko, who escaped Russia’s assault on Mariupol and moved to the Faroes in the spring of last year.</p>

<p>She now works at the Systrar café in Tórshavn's Nordic House, where she had made a large serving of her country’s national dish, borsch, for the special occasion.</p>

<p>Borsch is a hearty soup made with beets, cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, onions, garlic, dill and other ingredients.</p>

<p>“It’s a very special day, and it’s a very big holiday for us,” Sasha said while putting the finishing touches on her borsch.</p>

<p>“It’s difficult to know how many ingredients I need to put in because this is such a huge pot.”</p>

<p>Some of the vegetables and spices for the soup were flown in from Ukraine.</p>

<p>Malan Jógvansdóttir Poulsen, one of the many people who visited the Nordic house to celebrate Ukraine’s Independence Day, said: “I came here to taste Sasha’s food on Ukraine’s Independence Day, and it’s absolutely delicious. I’ll try to ask her for the recipe, but I’ve heard that you can google it.”</p>

<p>Sasha spent two days preparing the huge dish, and after 40 minutes, the pot was empty.</p>

<p>“I’m so happy because everyone said it was really tasty,” she said.</p>

<p>“It’s not the same to celebrate our Independence Day here in the Faroes, but I’m happy to be celebrating the day together with Faroese people and also a few Ukrainians.”</p>

<h1>Shorter school days: a new experiment</h1>
<h2>Tórshavn school is trialling shorter school days with the aim of boosting student performance</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/24/shorter-school-days-new-experiment</address>

<p>‘Quality over quantity’ is the key rationale behind a new trial project at Tórshavn’s á Fløtum school in which all pupils leave school no later than 1.30pm.</p>

<p>“We have seen over the past many years that the traditional eight-hour school days are far from optimal,” says school principal Regin Marnersson.</p>

<p>“Our main objective is to restructure the school day so we can squeeze more quality out of the hours we have with the hope that this will ultimately boost the productivity of our pupils.”</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2018/11/16/pupils-are-tired">Pupils are tired</a></p>

<p>The project is based on a committee report recently handed to the education minister, which recommends a maximum of 32 school hours per week for all pupils.</p>

<p>Initially, the main changes at the á Fløtum school involve the older classes, with combinations of subjects and a general restructuring of the school day, resulting in a six-hour school day.</p>

<p>“In the older classes, we are cutting the language subjects – Faroese, Danish and English – from four hours per week to two. And we are combining physics and chemistry into one ‘science’ subject,” says the principal.</p>

<p><strong>Good news for tired pupils</strong></p>

<p>The pupils we spoke to were happy with the new experiment:</p>

<p>“My friends and I used to be really tired in the final hours of the school day. Now we have lots of energy throughout the day and it’s much easier to focus,” says Elin Bergtórudóttir.</p>

<p>“This gives us more time and energy to focus on our homework, which is great,” says Jens Steingrímsson.</p>

<p>“Now I’m excited to go to school. Now we actually get something out of every school day, whereas before it was all about making it through the day,” says Anna Mohr Holm.</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2022/01/25/teachers-are-exhausted">Teachers are exhausted</a></p>

<p>Education minister Djóni Nolsøe Joensen supports the school’s initiative, saying it is in line with the government’s plan for a school reform.</p>

<p>“This project will give us some valuable practical insights while we work on the legal part of our school plan,” he says.</p>

<p>However, the Teachers’ Association has its reservations, with chairman Jacob Eli S. Olsen saying that this is uncharted territory and that a shorter school day is not necessarily a better school day.</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/node/147129">School refusal on the rise</a></p>

<p>“One of the many things we should keep in mind regarding such structural changes is whether we have enough after-school activities to offer these pupils while their parents are still at work,” he says.</p>

<p>“Before we draw any final conclusions about shorter school days, we need to assess this project from all angles.”</p>

<h1>Population hits all-time high</h1>
<h2>The Faroese population reached an all-time high of 54,601 on 1 July, of which 5.87 percent were non-Danish citizens</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/23/population-hits-all-time-high</address>

<p>The Faroese population has grown to the highest level ever recorded, reports <a href="https://hagstova.fo/en/news/population-surpasses-54600">Statistics Faroe Islands</a>.</p>

<p>The population growth is driven by net migration, with more people moving to the Faroe Islands than leaving. The excess of births over deaths also contributes to the growth.</p>

<h1>Difficult to protect pets from abuse</h1>
<h2>Legal limitations prevent adequate protection of domestic animals</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/22/difficult-protect-pets-abuse</address>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dvf.fo/">DvF</a>, the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, receives about ten reports of pet cruelty every month.</p>

<p>“We receive many reports of cruelty to dogs, specifically Border Collies,” explains Diana Krossá Kongsbak, of the DvF.</p>

<p>“The abuse ranges from neglect, such as leaving the animals outside in rough weather, to intentional and malicious animal abuse.”</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/node/152406">Dog owner fined for negligence</a></p>

<p>But limitations in the Animal Welfare Act make it difficult to establish mistreatment of domestic animals.</p>

<p>The law only covers livestock, or animals for industrial use, and it has not been updated since it came into force in 2018.</p>

<p>“Under the current law, we are not authorised to enter private properties. Often, all we can do is to call the owners if we receive reports of pets being mistreated,” she says.</p>

<p>“We frequently find that the owners simply don’t know about basic animal rights. In such cases, we inform them about basic animal rights. This is usually enough to solve the problem.”</p>

<p><strong>Police also have limitations</strong></p>

<p>In cases of severe animal abuse where the owners do not respond to advice from the DvF, the owner is reported to the police.</p>

<p>However, there are also limits to what the police can do.</p>

<p>“They can visit the property. But if they cannot immediately establish that severe animal cruelty has taken place, the case is usually dropped because the law does not state clearly enough what the police are authorised to do.”</p>

<h1>Young people&#039;s mental health: the paradox of choice</h1>
<h2>Endless options and high expectations have a negative effect on young people’s mental health, according to new Faroese study</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/21/young-peoples-mental-health-paradox-choice</address>

<p>A new study looks into the mental health of young people in the Faroes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02673843.2023.2242475?fbclid=IwAR044yLYa_HVZb_uVa5X8WdbY1-aWHzPW0Gb4tcapa1CwwvtPBr74cWl8R4">The study</a>, titled “The paradox of endless options and unrealistic expectations: understanding the impact on youth mental health” was conducted by the Faroese Board of Public Health last year.</p>

<p>“A recurring theme in our interviews with the young people was that the endless options available to them can have a negative effect on their mental health,” says co-author Monika Mohr.</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/node/146099">Concerns over growing psychiatry waiting lists</a></p>

<p>These options include what to study, where to live, what job to choose, when to have children and when to settle down with a spouse.</p>

<p>“Many of them worry about making the right decisions at the right time. This fills them with a sense of having to rush through life, a feeling that life is a task that has to be completed,” she explains.</p>

<p>“They worry that if they make the wrong decision, they may end up as a failure. This can create a great deal of pressure on many young people today.”</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/node/143256">Exam pressure “adds to pupils’ mental health problems”</a></p>

<p>Many young people feel that they have high expectations to live up to, both academically and in their personal lives. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.</p>

<p>“Everything is portrayed in a positive light on social media. People’s achievements are visible to everyone on social media. This creates an ideal that can be difficult to live up to for many young people,” explains Mohr.</p>

<p>“Our study indicates that this kind of comparison has a particularly negative effect on young women’s mental health.”</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2022/04/07/great-demand-psychological-treatment">Great demand for psychological treatment</a></p>

<p>The study also found that living in a small society can have both positive and negative effects on young people's mental health.</p>

<p>One negative effect of limited small-scale living, the study found, was that the choice of education is often restricted by the limited work opportunities in the Faroes, especially outside the central region.</p>

<p>The study suggests a need to address the factors that contribute to the poor mental health of young people in the Faroes.</p>

<p>This could include providing more support for young people, reducing the pressure on them to succeed and creating more opportunities for them to pursue their dreams.</p>

<h1>New York Times zooms in on Faroese research</h1>
<h2>An extensive article about Faroese research into the health risks of eating whale meat was published in the New York Times this week</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/19/new-york-times-zooms-faroese-research</address>

<p>Professor Pál Weihe has for decades been warning about the health risks of eating whale meat, much to the dismay of many Faroese people.</p>

<p>He has been insisting that children and pregnant women should avoid eating whale meat due to the high concentrations of harmful chemicals in the meat.</p>

<p>Back in the 1980s, he teamed up with Philippe Grandjean, a Danish professor of environmental medicine, and they have since published numerous papers on harmful chemicals, especially per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).</p>

<p>These are a group of man-made chemicals that are used in a variety of products, including nonstick cookware, stain-resistant fabrics, and firefighting foams.</p>

<h1>Police: no reason to fear Al-Qaeda threat in the Faroes</h1>
<h2>Terrorist group is calling for attacks in Denmark and Sweden in revenge for Koran burnings. Police say the Faroes are safe; however, information is scarce</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/18/police-no-reason-fear-al-qaeda-threat-faroes</address>

<p>Earlier this week, Al-Qaeda issued a call for violence against Denmark and Sweden.</p>

<p>The two countries are being heavily criticised by Muslim-majority countries for permitting anti-Islamic activists to publicly burn Islam's holy book.</p>

<p>“People of Islam in Sweden, Denmark and all of Europe, the duty of revenge is placed upon you,” Al-Qaeda’s media centre announced on Monday night.</p>

<p>Danish intelligence service PET considers this as a declaration of war.</p>

<p><strong>No threat to the Faroes</strong></p>

<p>However, although the Faroes are part of Denmark, there is no need to fear terror attacks in the Faroes, according to assistant commissioner Steen Nørskov.</p>

<p>“We are following the recommendations of the PET, and we are monitoring the situation closely,” he says.</p>

<p>“The current recommendations say that there is no danger of terrorism in the Faroe Islands.”</p>

<p>However, Nørskov declined to answer when asked whether the Faroes were mentioned in Al-Qaeda’s terror threat.</p>

<p>"I would advise the Faroese public to be vigilant but not unduly worried. As always, if you notice anything out of the ordinary, contact the police."</p>

<p><strong>Information is scarce</strong></p>

<p>Faroese foreign minister Høgni Hoydal said yesterday that Faroese authorities have not yet been informed of the full contents of Al-Qaeda’s threat letter.</p>

<p>The Danish foreign ministry has implemented special security measures to protect Danish diplomats abroad.</p>

<p>Hoydal said that Faroese authorities have so far not implemented any special security measures to protect Faroese diplomats.</p>

<p>“We are not regarding this as an issue related to the Faroe Islands and our international activities.”</p>

<p><strong>Security measures implemented</strong></p>

<p>The PET has declined KvF’s request for an interview, referring to an <a href="https://pet.dk/pet/nyhedsliste/faelles-udtalelse-fra-pet-og-fe-vedroerende-nylige-udmeldinger-fra-terrororganisationen-alqaeda/2023/08/15">official statement</a> on its website.</p>

<p>In short, the statement says that there is now an increased threat of terrorism against Denmark and Danish interests abroad and that the threat is being taken very seriously. The necessary security measures are being implemented in cooperation with other authorities.</p>

<h1>Faroes retain Aa2 credit rating</h1>
<h2>The Faroes have a very strong capacity to meet financial commitments, says major credit rating firm</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/17/faroes-retain-aa2-credit-rating</address>

<p>On Friday, American credit rating firm Moody’s announced that the Faroes retain their current Aa2 rating, reports the Faroese national bank.</p>

<p>Aa2 is the third-highest rating on Moody’s 21-level country risk rating scale.</p>

<p>A good credit rating is important as it attracts investors seeking safer, less volatile investments.</p>

<p>It also improves the interest rates that the national bank pays on loans from foreign investors.</p>

<p>Trøllanes resident Eyðun Eliasen estimates that there are currently about 2,000 puffins near his village.</p>

<p>“We are seeing a lot more seabirds on the bird cliffs now, especially puffins, but there is also an increase in guillemots and kittiwakes,” he says.</p>

<p>“When the situation was at its worst, we saw hundreds of dead baby seabirds in the nesting burrows. But now it’s looking much better.”</p>

<h1>Five more years with free online dictionaries</h1>
<h2>The government has renewed its deal with dictionary publisher Sprotin</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/12/five-more-years-free-online-dictionaries</address>

<p>The public will have free access to the dictionaries on <a href="http://sprotin.fo">sprotin.fo</a> for another five years.</p>

<p>This was announced yesterday, when the Ministry of Culture, local councils and dictionary publisher Sprotin extended their deal by another five years.</p>

<p>In addition to ongoing dictionary revisions, the work on <a href="https://kvf.fo/node/143574">Japanese</a>, Portuguese and Greenlandic dictionary projects will be completed.</p>

<p>The government has acquired the option to purchase the dictionary portfolio in case Sprotin goes out of business, plans to transfer its rights or changes ownership.</p>

<h1>Faroes to adopt EU drone laws</h1>
<h2>Planned regulation changes will make drone operating rules clearer for tourists</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/11/faroes-adopt-eu-drone-laws</address>

<p>The existing drone regulations are outdated and confusing for tourists, according to the government.</p>

<p>A simple and effective solution is to adopt EU regulations on drone operations. However, the plan is to adapt these regulations to Faroese conditions.</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2019/08/16/illegal-drone-activity-rise">Unauthorised drone activity on the rise</a></p>

<p>The government says the regulation changes will help to avoid problems that often arise when tourists operate drones because Faroese drone regulations are different from those in other countries.</p>

<p>The planned changes will include regulations about operating a drone while under the influence of drugs or alcohol and how drone operating licences are withdrawn.</p>

<h1>Careless whale watchers risk DKK 1,000 fine</h1>
<h2>Warning signs have been set up along road where cars stop to watch a group of playful whales</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/11/careless-whale-watchers-risk-dkk-1000-fine</address>

<p>About a week ago, road signs were set up along a road near Tórshavn that has been the subject of repeated traffic safety violations.</p>

<p>As you may have read <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/04/playful-whales-still-hinder-traffic">last week</a>, this is to warn drivers against stopping abruptly to watch three bottlenose whales that have been putting on an adorable show in the Kaldbaksfjørður inlet for the past month.</p>

<h1>Children and teens targeted by scammers</h1>
<h2>Many children and teenagers in the Faroes received a phishing SMS message yesterday</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/11/children-and-teens-targeted-scammers</address>

<p>BankNordik is warning against a phishing scam sent via SMS messages to children and teenagers yesterday.</p>

<p>Digital scammers are skilled at deceiving young people, which is why parents are urged to monitor their children’s online activities, says BankNordik.</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/node/148684">First ‘Faroese’ phishing attack</a></p>

<p>The bank has issued the following tips for parents:</p>

<p>• Teach your child about personal information and how to protect it</p>

<p>• Parents should be familiar with the most common scams targeted at children</p>

<p>• Monitor your child’s social media use and create a good framework for talking about safe online behaviour and habits</p>

<p>• If your child has clicked the link in the message and disclosed personal information, freeze the child’s credit/debit card immediately. This can be done in your bank’s online portal.</p>

<h1>New York flights less popular than expected</h1>
<h2>Atlantic Airways is trimming its New York schedule by two departures this autumn due to low demand</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/10/new-york-flights-less-popular-expected</address>

<p>There was a great deal of excitement when Atlantic Airways announced its <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/03/23/direct-flights-usa-august">direct flights to New York</a> this spring.</p>

<p>However, the initial hype did not result in the anticipated level of demand.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the airline is cutting two of its seven autumn departures to New York.</p>

<p>There are several possible reasons for this lacklustre demand, according to Atlantic Airways CEO Jóhanna á Bergi.</p>

<p>“One reason may be that we did not receive all the required authorisations to fly to New York until May, by which time many people may have already made their summer and autumn holiday plans,” she says.</p>

<p>“And, as we began selling tickets to New York, we sent ten full planes to Berlin in connection with the Faroese participation in the handball championships there. I’m sure that this diverted some potential passengers away from our New York flights."</p>

<h1>Happy days for Faroese sports fans</h1>
<h2>Faroese sportspeople are making international headlines these days. Expanded horizons and higher ambitions are the secret to this success, says veteran athlete</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/10/happy-days-faroese-sports-fans</address>

<p>KÍ Klaksvík sensationally beat Norwegian football champions Molde in Tuesday’s first leg of the third qualifying round in the Champions League.</p>

<p>The U-19 men’s handball national team saw off giants such as Sweden and Germany on their way to the quarter-finals of the IHF Men's Youth (U19) World Championship, where they today suffered a narrow defeat to Egypt.</p>

<p>The U-17 women’s handball national team triumphed over Greece and Israel on their way to the semi-finals of the Women's 17 EHF Championship. Today, however, they were knocked out by Spain.</p>

<p>And Jónas G. Isaksen yesterday won gold in the 400-metre dash at the European Athletics U20 Championships.</p>

<p>Results like these can be put down to a fundamental change of mindset among today’s young atheletes, according to former shot put athlete Heri Ziska.</p>

<p>“Today’s athletes simply have higher ambitions. Athletes and coaches are now working much more actively to reach beyond the confines of our domestic leagues,” he says.</p>

<p>“Our inferiority complex appears to have vanished.”</p>

<p>Ziska currently works as a physical coach for Hoyvík’s H71 handball team, and he witnesses this ambition every day in his work.</p>

<p>“There are times when we almost need to ask the young players to go home. We tell them, ‘That’s enough for today, boys and girls’. But their ambition is simply unstoppable,” he explains.</p>

<p>“This drive has a ripple effect across our entire sports community. The result is an incredible evolution in which it is no longer okay to just take part in international tournaments. Now they aim beyond the first rounds – and, as we’re seeing, that’s exactly where they are going. It’s pretty impressive.”</p>

<h1>Big cleanup day coming up</h1>
<h2>Towns and villages across the country are looking for volunteer coordinators for the annual cleanup day</h2>

<p>Stanislav Horbovtsov’s last journey took place on Sunday, down through Vágar’s Bøsdalafossur waterfall and out into the North Atlantic.</p>

<p>Stas, as his loved ones call him, was killed in a Russian attack in Bakhmut on 23 December.</p>

<p>His mother, Liudmila Horbovtsova, and his widow, Lubov Golubeva, arrived at Vágar Airport on Sunday carrying Stas’ ashes in an urn.</p>

<p>Hydroelectric power accounted for 23 percent of the total, which is slightly less than last year.</p>

<h1>Military plane flying at low altitude</h1>
<h2>A military transport aircraft was spotted flying low over the Faroes yesterday afternoon</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/06/military-plane-flying-low-altitude</address>

<p>Many residents in the central region of the Faroes yesterday reported seeing a large military transport aircraft flying at low altitude.</p>

<p>It has so far not been possible to identify the aircraft. The control tower at Vágar Airport is not authorised to disclose any such information, and the Arctic Command has not responded to our request for comment.</p>

<p>We have spoken to aviation enthusiasts, and they say the plane is most likely a Lockheed C-130 Hercules, a four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft.</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2022/02/11/russian-jets-did-not-enter-faroese-airspace">Russian jets did not enter Faroese airspace</a></p>

<p>There are no indications that the plane has landed in the Faroes because it has not been spotted on Vágar Airport’s web camera.</p>

<p>It resembles a French Hercules aircraft which was spotted at Vágar Airport a few days ago.</p>

<p>Denmark has planes of this type, but this one appears to have a darker shade of grey than the Danish ones.</p>

<p>This leads the aviation enthusiasts to conclude that the plane is either French or British.</p>

<h1>Festival security guard punched in the face</h1>
<h2>Police have been kept busy at Klaksvík’s Summarfestivalur</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/05/festival-security-guard-punched-face</address>

<p>Two cases of assault were reported between 2pm and 3pm last night at the Summarfestival in Klaksvík.</p>

<p>A security guard was reportedly punched in the face by a festivalgoer.</p>

<p>Police say the suspect is an old offender. The guard has been taken to hospital for observation.</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/07/26/summarfestival-programme-announced">Summarfestival programme announced</a></p>

<p>In the other assault case, details are currently scarce, but a man has been detained.</p>

<p>Many eyewitnesses were present, and they, along with the suspect, will be interviewed today.</p>

<p>Police also picked up five people who had drunk too much last night – four in Klaksvík and one in Tórshavn. Relatives have been asked to come and pick them up.</p>

<p><strong>Earplugs for festivalgoers</strong></p>

<p>Visitors at the Summarfestival are being offered earplugs free of charge to protect their hearing during the concerts.</p>

<p>Hoyr, an interest organisation for people with hearing loss, handed out about 1,200 pairs of earplugs on Thursday, which was the first day of the festival.</p>

<p>”We are happy to be working with the Summarfestival team because we want to ensure that everyone, young and old, is as safe as possible at music festivals,” said a Hoyr spokesperson.</p>

<h1>Playful whales still hinder traffic</h1>
<h2>Cars stopping to watch the three bottlenose whales playing in the water near Tórshavn are causing a potential traffic hazard</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/04/playful-whales-still-hinder-traffic</address>

<p>It is now three weeks since <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/07/20/jumping-whales-stop-traffic">three bottlenose whales</a> were first spotted in the Kaldbaksfjørður inlet near Tórshavn.</p>

<p>Many cars stop abruptly when the passengers see this rare sight, and that presents a potential traffic hazard, according to the police.</p>

<p><strong>Show consideration</strong></p>

<p>It is not against the law to stop at the side of the Kaldbaksvegur road. However, police advise drivers to show consideration to other road users.</p>

<p>“As the road has an 80 km/h speed limit, slamming the brakes on the car when seeing the whales is not responsible traffic behaviour,” says a police spokesperson.</p>

<p>“It would be very helpful if drivers who want to watch the whales continue to the road at the other end of the inlet before stopping because there is a lot less traffic there.”</p>

<h1>Tax incentives to encourage long-term home rentals</h1>
<h2>The government is working on ways to incentivise long-term rentals amid boom in short-term Airbnb rentals</h2>

<p>The á Reyni district in Tórshavn’s city centre used to be a lively place where neighbours visited each other and children played around the houses.</p>

<p>Today, however, the community spirit in the old-town neighbourhood appears much less vibrant.</p>

<p>“Many of the houses around us are empty most of the year,” says Kristian Blak, who has lived in the district for almost 50 years.</p>

<p>“But then, in the summer, we see people in these houses and we don’t know who they are. It leaves us with a bit of an empty feeling.”</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/node/143337">717 unoccupied homes in capital region</a></p>

<p><a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2021/12/07/more-2600-unoccupied-houses">Figures from 2021</a> show that of the approximately 18,880 residential properties in the Faroes, 2,614 (about 14 percent) are not occupied by full-time residents.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the country is experiencing a massive housing shortage.</p>

<p>This is a problem, and the government is working on solutions.</p>

<p>One such solution is imposing mandatory occupancy requirements for homeowners and introducing service charges for homeowners who do not reside in the municipality where their house is located.</p>

<p>The government is currently negotiating this with local councils.</p>

<p>But this is not enough to solve the problem, says Ingilín D. Strøm, the Minister of Environment, Industry and Trade, who is also responsible for housing.</p>

<p>“We know that some local councils have requested these mandatory occupancy requirements and service charges for homeowners, but we cannot guarantee that all local councils would adopt this approach,” she says.</p>

<p>Back to á Reyni resident Kristian Blak, who was born in Denmark but moved to the Faroes in 1974:</p>

<p>“Having close relations with our neighbours has meant a whole lot to us over the years,” he says.</p>

<p>“This new situation has somehow strenghtened the bond among those of us who remain in the district. But there are times when we feel a bit lonely here.”</p>

<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/08/01/influx-foreign-nationals-requires-thoughtful-legislation</address>

<p>The upcoming integration law must ensure that immigration does not spiral out of control, according to integration minister Bjarni Kárason Petersen.</p>

<p>“The number of migrant workers and immigrants arriving in the Faroes is currently so high that we are struggling to manage everything properly. That is why we feel a need to introduce some restrictions,” he says.</p>

<p>“These people are of course welcome to our country, but we need to make sure the high numbers do not overwhelm our system.”</p>

<p>Petersen’s statement is a continuation of what Prime Minister Aksel V. Johannesen said in his ólavsøku speech about ensuring that the large influx of foreign nationals does not become overwhelming and that we must ensure a balance between the rights and duties of those who come to the Faroes from abroad.</p>

<p>The restrictions the integration minister is referring to mainly consist of a proposed amendment to the directive on <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/07/03/what-foreign-workers-must-earn-bring-family-faroes">minimum income</a> for foreign workers who want to bring family members to the Faroes.</p>

<p>The reason for these changes, according to the minister, is that the number of foreign nationals arriving in the Faroes either through family reunification or as accompanying family members of a foreign worker has more than doubled since the <a href="https://kvf.fo/node/150883">fast-track</a> employment programme was introduced in late 2021.</p>

<p>In 2021, 48 foreign nationals arrived in the Faroes through family reunification or as accompanying family members of foreign workers. This number reached 118 in 2022.</p>

<p>“It is important to find a healthy balance between the rights and duties of foreign nationals who come to our country because a big and sudden increase of foreign nationals puts pressure on our social services, schools, health system, etc.,” says Petersen.</p>

<p>“To strike this balance, the integration bill will cater to those who become permanent residents, and we are looking at ways to adjust the fast-track employment programme for migrant workers to ensure that these people and their accompanying families also have proper living conditions.”</p>

<h1>Fourteen same-sex couples married in the Faroes</h1>
<h2>Faroese and Icelandic ministers took part in Thursday’s Faroe Pride parade</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/07/31/fourteen-same-sex-couples-married-faroes</address>

<p>Eight female and six male couples have been married in the Faroes since the marriage act was amended in 2017.</p>

<p>These figures, courtesy of Statistics Faroe Islands, are based on at least one spouse residing in the Faroes at the time of the wedding.</p>

<p>The annual Faroe Pride took place on Thursday.</p>

<p>Among the participants were Sirið Stenberg, the Minister of Social Affairs and Culture, and Bjarni Kárason Petersen, the Minister of Justice and Integration.</p>

<p>Joining them on the parade was Iceland’s Minister of Social Affairs and the Labour Market, Gudmundur Ingi Gudbrandsson, who is the first openly gay man to serve in the Icelandic government.</p>

<h1>Tougher laws to protect children online</h1>
<h2>Sexual grooming and sextortion have so far not been punishable by law. This is set to change next year</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/07/30/tougher-laws-protect-children-online</address>

<p>The Ministry of Justice is taking swift action in the wake of what has been dubbed the largest paedophilia case in Faroese history.</p>

<p>We reported <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/07/18/police-lookout-sexual-groomers">earlier this month</a> that police had identified 14 children who have been subjected to online grooming in the Faroes and that the real number may be significantly higher.</p>

<p>Online grooming is where a person befriends a child online and builds up their trust with the intention of exploiting them. Harm caused by grooming can be sexual abuse, both in person and online, and exploitation to obtain sexually explicit images and videos of a child.</p>

<p><strong>A priority matter</strong></p>

<p>This news has prompted the Ministry of Justice to prepare legislation that explicitly makes sexual grooming a culpable activity, along with tightening the punishment for sexual extortion, also known as sextortion.</p>

<p>“These legislative changes have been in the making for some time, but this recent news from the police is speeding up our work,” says justice minister Bjarni Kárason Petersen.</p>

<p>“Our aim is to have these law changes ready by 1 January 2024. I can’t imagine any parliamentary opposition to our proposal, so the changes should be ready by that time.”</p>

<h1>Photos: ólavsøka 2023 – a washout</h1>
<h2>Lots of people are celebrating the ólavsøka national holidays in Tórshavn, but most of them are keeping to indoor parties</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/07/29/photos-olavsoka-2023-washout</address>

<p>Some parts of the country have had decent weather in the past couple of days, but the capital, which hosts the ólavsøka festivities, has been drenched in rain pretty much non-stop.</p>

<p>Umbrellas were the order of the day yesterday, and that will most likely continue for the rest of today, too.</p>

<h1>Ólavsøka, the big test for Tórshavn’s new canal</h1>
<h2>The city centre has become less spacious for pedestrians</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/07/27/olavsoka-big-test-torshavns-new-canal</address>

<p>Tórshavn’s new canal occupies a space that used to be packed with people during the ólavsøka national holidays, celebrated annually on 28-29 July.</p>

<p>Ólavsøkuaftan, 28 July, will see a large procession consisting of sportspeople and horses.</p>

<p>On ólavsøkudagur, 29 July, thousands gather there in the afternoon for the official ólavsøka opening ceremony. And at night, the crowd more than doubles for the popular midnight singalong.</p>

<p>The area was always rather small for crowds of this size; now it’s even smaller. So, how will the canal affect the ólavsøka celebrations?</p>

<h1>Reading improves children’s lives</h1>
<h2>Children and teenagers who read at least 20 minutes a day do better in life than those who do not, new research suggests</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/07/25/reading-improves-childrens-lives</address>

<p>It makes good sense that building a steady reading habit at an early age improves a child’s future prospects.</p>

<p>So says Eilen Anthoniussen, coordinator at ’Føroyar Lesa’ (’the Faroes Read’), about new international research which indicates that children who read at least 20 minutes a day do better in life than those who read less.</p>

<p>Children who read 20 minutes a day develop better language skills, have higher self-confidence and attain better education later in life, according to the ‘Progress in International Reading Literacy Study’ (PIRLS) study, conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA).</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/node/148022">Growing concern over children’s lack of reading</a></p>

<p>“These findings are positive and useful because similar studies often only reveal that children don’t read enough,” says Anthoniussen.</p>

<p>She mentions other research which suggests that reading improves memory and reduces stress.</p>

<p>“Reading is good, regardless of whether it’s regular books, e-books or audiobooks. There is lots of research showing that children should be exposed to reading as early as possible.”</p>

<p>‘Føroyar Lesa’ has for the past three years been campaigning in schools and elsewhere for the importance of focused reading.</p>

<h1>Faroese CO2 emissions drop for first time in a decade</h1>
<h2>Last year was the first time in more than a decade with significantly lower carbon emissions than in the previous year</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/07/25/faroese-co2-emissions-drop-first-time-decade</address>

<p>In 2022, carbon emissions in the Faroes fell by 6 percent compared to 2021.</p>

<p>This is the first time in more than ten years that carbon emissions have fallen significantly, according to the Faroese Environment Agency.</p>

<p>The main reason is that more electricity came from renewable energy sources in 2022 than in 2021.</p>

<h1>Toll gates “a nuisance to locals and tourists alike”</h1>
<h2>Toll gates in popular tourist areas discourage Faroese people from enjoying nature, argues interest organisation</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/07/24/toll-gates-nuisance-locals-and-tourists-alike</address>

<p>The highly contested matter of freedom to explore nature is once again making headlines.</p>

<p>Hagafelagið, an interest organisation aiming to secure public access to the wilderness, has called on all political parties to reconsider their stance on toll gates in tourist hotspots.</p>

<p>“We’re heading in the wrong direction by setting up all these toll gates,” says a Hagafelagið spokeswoman.</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/07/07/hiking-fees-tourists-kalsoy">Hiking fees for tourists in Kalsoy</a></p>

<p>“Our laws are usually based on the practices of neighbouring countries. These countries tend to have values and systems that are similar to ours, and they are often more advanced than us. In these countries, the so-called ‘everyman’s right’ principle, or the right of public access to the wilderness, is enshrined in legislation.”</p>

<p>Hagafelagið wants politicians to realise that the growing number of toll gates not only sends a negative signal to tourists; it also discourages Faroese people from exploring the countryside.</p>

<p><strong> &gt;&gt; SEE ALSO</strong> <a href="https://kvf.fo/node/146210">Survey supports freedom to roam in nature</a></p>

<p>“These gates are very unsympathetic, and they alienate Faroese people from their natural environment. Public access to nature used to be an unquestionable right,” says the spokeswoman.</p>

<p>“We should do something about this immediately rather than experimenting with alternatives. When all the countries around us operate on the everyman’s right principle, why should we try to reinvent the wheel?”</p>

<h1>Complaints over smelly manure in Hoyvík</h1>
<h2>Residents say they cannot open their windows due to foul smell. City Council is working on a solution</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/07/23/complaints-over-smelly-manure-hoyvik</address>

<p>Residents in Hoyvík’s Millum Gilja district have sent Tórshavn City Council a complaint about foul smell emanating from a nearby farm.</p>

<p>They say the manure stench is severely affecting their well-being and that they have not been able to open windows or doors since 17 July.</p>

<p>Some households are also said to be experiencing allergy symptoms as a result of the stench.</p>

<p><strong>Doctor: it can be harmful</strong></p>

<p>Foul smell is not a health hazard as such, says public health professor Pál Weihe.</p>

<p>However, particles in the drizzle may be harmful as they may cause irritation in the lungs.</p>

<p>“And foul smell obviously affects people’s well-being and mental health, so this is something that should be taken seriously.”</p>

<p><strong>Not illegal</strong></p>

<p>According to the directive on manure use, farmers are permitted to apply manure at this time of year, though with certain conditions.</p>

<p>One condition is that when manure is spread near residential areas, farmers should be mindful of how the smell can spread.</p>

<p>To the extent possible, farmers are advised to avoid applying manure when the wind is blowing towards residential areas.</p>

<p>The City Council says it is working with the farmer to find a solution.</p>

<h2>Tórshavn residents were treated a beautiful new sight in the city centre this morning</h2>
<address>https://kvf.fo/greinar/2023/07/21/photos-canal-opens-torshavn</address>

<p>The fence, which has been a cause of annoyance for many Tórshavn residents for months, has finally been taken down, and the new canal running through the city centre is now open for all to see.</p>

<p>Many Tórshavn residents who have been sceptical of the city centre canal appeared to have changed their minds when they saw the finished construction this morning.</p>

<p>The official canal opening ceremony starts tomorrow morning at 10am, featuring speeches, live music and a big breakfast table.</p>

<p>The programme for the ceremony is available <a href="https://www.torshavn.fo/tidindi/havnara-letur-upp">here</a> (in Faroese only).</p>
